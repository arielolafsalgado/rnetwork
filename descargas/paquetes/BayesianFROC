<h2>BayesianFROC: FROC Analysis by Bayesian Approaches</h2>
<p>Execute BayesianFROC::fit_GUI_Shiny() (or fit_GUI_Shiny_MRMC()) for a graphical user interface via Shiny.  Provides new methods for the so-called Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) analysis. The ultimate aim of FROC analysis is to compare observer performances, which means comparing characteristics, such as area under the curve (AUC) or figure of merit (FOM).
