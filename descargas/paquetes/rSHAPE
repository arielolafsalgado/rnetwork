<h2>rSHAPE: Simulated Haploid Asexual Population Evolution</h2>
<p>In silico experimental evolution offers a cost-and-time effective means to test evolutionary hypotheses.  Existing evolutionary simulation tools focus on simulations in a limited experimental framework, and tend to report on only the results presumed of interest by the tools designer.  The R-package for Simulated Haploid Asexual Population Evolution ('rSHAPE') addresses these concerns by implementing a robust simulation framework that outputs complete population demographic and genomic information for in silico evolving communities.  Allowing more than 60 parameters to be specified, 'rSHAPE'	simulates evolution across discrete time-steps for an evolving community of haploid asexual populations with binary state genomes.  These settings are for the current state of 'rSHAPE' and future steps will be to increase the breadth of evolutionary conditions permitted.  At present, most effort was placed into permitting varied growth models to be simulated (such as constant size, exponential growth, and logistic growth) as well as various fitness landscape models to reflect the evolutionary landscape (e.g.: Additive, House of Cards - Stuart Kauffman and Simon Levin (1987) &lt;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016%2FS0022-5193%2887%2980029-2">doi:10.1016/S0022-5193(87)80029-2</a>&gt;, NK - Stuart A.
