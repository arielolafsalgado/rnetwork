<h2>RJafroc: Analyzing Diagnostic Observer Performance Studies</h2>
<p>Implements software for assessing medical imaging systems, radiologists or computer aided detection algorithms. 
    Models of observer performance are implemented, including the binormal model (BM), the contaminated binormal model (CBM), the 
    correlated contaminated binormal model (CORCBM), and the radiological search model (RSM). The software and applications are 
    described in a book - Chakraborty DP: Observer Performance Methods for Diagnostic Imaging - Foundations, Modeling, and 
    Applications with R-Based Examples. Taylor-Francis LLC; 2017 - and its vignettes &lt;<a href="https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafroc/">https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafroc/</a>&gt;. 
    Observer performance data collection paradigms are the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and its location specific 
    extensions, primarily free-response ROC (FROC) and the location ROC (LROC). ROC data consists of single ratings per images. 
    A rating is the perceived confidence level that the image is that of a diseased patient. FROC data consists of a variable 
    number (including zero) of mark-rating pairs per image, where a mark is the location of a clinically reportable suspicious region 
    and the rating is the corresponding confidence level that it is a real lesion. LROC data consists of a rating and a forced 
    localization of the most suspicious region on every image. RJafroc supersedes the Windows version of JAFROC software 
    V4.2.1, &lt;<a href="http://www.devchakraborty.com">http://www.devchakraborty.com</a>&gt;:. Package functions are organized as follows. Data file related function names are 
    preceded by Df, curve fitting functions by Fit, included data sets by dataset, plotting functions by

    binormal model (CBM), the correlated contaminated binormal model (CORCBM) and the radiological search model (RSM). Unlike the

    yields measures of search and lesion-classification performances. Search performance is the ability to find lesions while
