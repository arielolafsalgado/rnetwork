<h2>PP3: Three-Dimensional Exploratory Projection Pursuit</h2>
<p>Exploratory projection pursuit is a method to discovers
	structure in multivariate data. At heart this package uses
	a projection index to evaluate how interesting a specific
	three-dimensional projection of multivariate data (with more
	than three dimensions) is. Typically, the main structure
	finding algorithm starts at a random projection and then
	iteratively changes the projection direction to move to
	a more interesting one. In other words, the projection index
	is maximised over the projection direction to find the most
	interesting projection. This maximum is, though, a local
	maximum. So, this code has the ability to restart the
	algorithm from many different starting positions automatically.
	Routines exist to plot a density estimate of projection indices 
	over the runs, this enables the user to obtain an idea of
	the distribution of the projection indices,
	and, hence,  which ones might be interesting. Individual
	projection solutions, including those identified as interesting,
	can be extracted and plotted individually. The package
	can make use of the mclapply() function to execute multiple runs in
	parallel to speed up index discovery. Projection pursuit is
	similar to independent component analysis. This package
	uses a projection index that maximises an entropy measure to
	look for projections that exhibit non-normality, and operates
	on sphered data. Hence, information from this package is
	different from that obtained from principal components analysis,
	but the rationale behind both methods is similar.
