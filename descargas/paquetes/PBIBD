<p>The PBIB designs are important type of incomplete block designs having wide area of their applications for example in agricultural experiments, in plant breeding, in sample surveys etc. This package constructs various series of PBIB designs and assists in checking all the necessary conditions of PBIB designs and the association scheme on which these designs are based on. It also assists in calculating the efficiencies of PBIB designs with any number of associate classes.
