Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Yamini", "Pandari", email = "yamseee@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A hybrid method of feature selection which combines both filter and wrapper methods. The first level involves feature reduction based on some of the important Filter methods while the second level involves feature subset selection as in a wrapper method. Experimental results show that this hybrid feature selection algorithm simplifies the feature selection process effectively and obtains higher classification accuracy, reduced processing time and improved data handling capacity than other feature selection algorithms.
