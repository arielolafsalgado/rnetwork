Description: Genomic selection (GS) is recent development in animal and plant breeding. In GS whole genome markers information is used to predict genetic merit of an individual. This package is basically developed for genomic predictions by estimating marker effects. These marker effects are then further used for calculation of genotypic merit of individual i.e. genome estimated breeding values (GEBVs). However, as genetic correlations between quantitative traits under breeding studies are obvious. These correlations indicate that one trait carry information over other traits. Current, single-trait genomic selection (STGS) methods could not able to utilize this information. Genomic selection based on multiple traits (MTGS) could be a better alternative to STGS. This package performs genomic selection using multi traits information hence named as MTGS i.e. multi trait genomic selection. MTGS is a comprehensive package which gives single step solution for genomic selection using various MTGS based methods.
