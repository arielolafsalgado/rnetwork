Description: The Gaussian graphical model is a widely used tool for learning gene regulatory networks with high-dimensional gene expression data. For many real problems, the data are heterogeneous, which may contain some subgroups or come from different resources. This package provide a Gaussian Graphical Mixture Model (GGMM) for the heterogeneous data. You can refer to Jia, B. and Liang, F. (2018) at <arXiv:1805.02547> for detail.
