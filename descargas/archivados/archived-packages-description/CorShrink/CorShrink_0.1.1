Description: Performs adaptive shrinkage of correlation and covariance matrices
    using a mixture model prior over the Fisher z-transformation of the correlations,
    Stephens (2016) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041> with the method flexible in choosing
    a separate shrinkage intensity for each cell of the correlation or covariance
    matrices: it is particularly efficient in handling missing data in the data matrix.
