Description: Method proposed in "Simultaneous Sparse Dictionary Learning and Pruning" ( Qu and Wang (2016) <arXiv:1605.07870>) is implemented. The idea is to conduct a linear decomposition of a signal using a few atoms of a learned and usually over-completed dictionary instead of a pre-defined basis. A proper size of the to-be-learned dictionary is determining at the same time during the procedure. Application includes image denoising and image inpainting.
