Description: An implementation of Bayesian Aggregation in Genomic Applications (BiG), where BiG is
    a Bayesian latent variable approach to aggregation of partial and top ranked lists 
    (Li et. al in preparation). It provides implementations for three different prior setups
	for variance/standard deviation parameters: diffuse inverse gamma (IG), diffuse uniform, half-t.
