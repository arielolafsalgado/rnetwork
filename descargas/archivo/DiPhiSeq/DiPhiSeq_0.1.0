Description: Implements the algorithm described in Jun Li and Alicia T. Lamere, 
    "DiPhiSeq: Robust comparison of expression levels on RNA-Seq data with large sample sizes"  (Unpublished). 
    Detects not only genes that show different 
    average expressions ("differential expression", DE), but also genes that show different 
    diversities of expressions in different groups ("differentially dispersed", DD). DD genes 
    can be important clinical markers. 'DiPhiSeq' uses a redescending penalty on the 
    quasi-likelihood function, and thus has superior robustness against outliers and other noise.
