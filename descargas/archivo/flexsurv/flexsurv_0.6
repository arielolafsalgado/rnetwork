Description: Flexible parametric models for time-to-event data, including the Royston-Parmar spline model, generalized gamma and generalized F distributions.   Any user-defined parametric distribution can be fitted, given at least an R function defining the probability density or hazard.  There are also tools for fitting and predicting from fully parametric multi-state models.
