Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Piotr", "Fryzlewicz", email = "p.fryzlewicz@lse.ac.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Performs multiple change-point detection in data sequences, or data sequence
    segmentation, using computationally efficient multiscale methods. This version only
    implements the "Tail-Greedy Unbalanced Haar" change-point detection methodology; more
    methods will be added in future versions. To start with, see the function
    segment.mean.
