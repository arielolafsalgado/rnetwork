Title: Analysis of RNA Cytosine-5 Methylation

Description: Bisulfite-treated RNA non-conversion in a set of samples is analysed as
    follows: each sample's Poisson parameter is estimated, and non-conversion
    p-values are calculated for each sample and adjusted for multiple testing.
    Finally, combined non-conversion p-value and standard error of the non-conversion
    are calculated on the intersection of the set of samples.
    A low combined non-conversion p-value points to methylation of the
    corresponding RNA cytosine, or another event blocking bisulfite conversion.
