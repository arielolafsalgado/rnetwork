Description: Contains a set of functions that allow to represent multivariate on a subspace of low dimension, in such a way that most of the variability of the information is captured. This representation is carried out through the 'HJ Biplot' methodology. A first method performs the 'HJ Biplot'.Then, the package implements three new techniques and constructs in each case the 'HJ Biplot', adapting restrictions to contract and / or produce zero charges in the main components, using three methods of regularization: Ridge, LASSO and Elastic Net.
