Description: Displays palette of 5 colors based on photos depicting the unique 
             and vibrant culture of Punjab in Northern India. Since Punjab translates 
             to ``Land of 5 Rivers'' there are 5 colors per palette. If users need 
             more than 5 colors, they can merge 2 to 3 palettes to create their own 
             color-combination, or they can cherry-pick their own custom colors. 
             Users can view up to 3 palettes together. Users can also list all the 
             palette choices. And last but not least, users can see the photo that 
             inspired a particular palette.
