Description: Displays palette of 5 colors based on photos depicting the unique and vibrant culture of Punjab
             in Northern India. Since Punjab translates to "Land of 5 Rivers" there are 5 colors per palette.
             If users need more than 5 colors, they can 2 merge palettes to create their own color-combination.
             Users can view colors of 1 or 2 palettes together. Users can also list all the palette choices.
             And last but not least, users can see the photo that inspired a particular palette.
