Description: A collection of functions for top-down exploratory data analysis
    of spectral data including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR),
    Raman, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and other similar types of spectroscopy.
    Includes functions for plotting and inspecting spectra, peak alignment,
    hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal components analysis (PCA) and
    model-based clustering. Robust methods appropriate for this type of high-dimensional
    data are available. ChemoSpec is designed for structured experiments, such as
    metabolomics investigations, where the samples fall into treatment and
    control groups. Graphical output is formatted consistently for publication quality
    plots. ChemoSpec is intended to be very user friendly and to help you get usable
    results quickly. A vignette covering typical operations is available.
