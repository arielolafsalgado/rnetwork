Description: A collection of functions for top-down exploratory data analysis
    of spectral data obtained via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR) or
    Raman spectroscopy. Includes functions for plotting and inspecting spectra, peak
    alignment, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal components analysis
    (PCA) and model-based clustering. Robust methods appropriate for this type of
    high-dimensional data are available. ChemoSpec is designed with metabolomics
    data sets in mind, where the samples fall into groups such as treatment and
    control. Graphical output is formatted consistently for publication quality
    plots. ChemoSpec is intended to be very user friendly and help you get usable
    results quickly. A vignette covering typical operations is available.
