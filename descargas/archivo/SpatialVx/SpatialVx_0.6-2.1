Description: Spatial forecast verification arose from verifying high-resolution forecasts, where coarser-resolution models generally are favored even when a human forecaster finds the higher-resolution model to be considerably better.  Most newly proposed methods, which largely come from image analysis, computer vision, and similar, are available, with more on the way.
