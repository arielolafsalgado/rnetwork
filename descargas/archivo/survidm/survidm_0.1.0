Description: Newly developed methods for the estimation of several probabilities
      in an illness-death model. The package can be used to obtain nonparametric and 
      semiparametric estimates for: transition probabilities, occupation probabilities, 
      cumulative incidence function and the sojourn time distributions. 
      Several auxiliary functions are also provided which can be used for marginal 
      estimation of the survival functions.
