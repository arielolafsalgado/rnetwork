Description: Produces heat maps, contour plots, bar plots (in 3D) and surface plots (also, in 3D). Is designed for plotting functions of two variables, however, can plot relatively arbitrary matrices. Uses HCL color space, extensively. Also, supports triangular plots and nested matrices.
Note: My website contains copies of Ross Ihaka's notes on graphics,
        including color spaces.
