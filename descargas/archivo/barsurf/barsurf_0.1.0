Description: Implements plots of discrete functions (bar plots) and continuous functions (surface plots) in 3D. Uses orthographic projection, a nonstandard fixed viewing angle, does not support detailed axes and is designed to be relatively minimal and simple, from a programming perspective. However, does support mixed bar sizes and multiple colors.
