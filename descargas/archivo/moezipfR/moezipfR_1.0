Description: Statistical utilities for the analysis of data by means of the Marshall-Olkin Extended Zipf distribution. By plotting the probabilities in log-log scale, this two parameter distribution allows a concave as well as a convex behavior of the function at the beginning of the distribution, maintaining the linearity in the tail. The model contains the Zipf model as a particular case.
