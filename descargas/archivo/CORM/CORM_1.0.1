Description: We proposed a new model-based clustering method, called the clustering of 
             regression models method(CORM), which groups genes that share a similar 
             relationship to the covariate(s). This method provides a unified approach 
             for a family of clustering procedures and can be applied to data collected 
             with various experimental designs. This package includes the implementation 
             for two such clustering procedures: (1) the Clustering of Linear Models 
             (CLM) method, and (2) the Clustering of Linear Mixed Models (CLMM) method.
