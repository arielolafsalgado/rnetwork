Description: Incorporates functions for image preprocessing, filtering and image recognition. The package takes advantage of 'RcppArmadillo' to speed up computationally intensive functions. The histogram of oriented gradients descriptor is a modification of the 'findHOGFeatures' function of the 'SimpleCV' computer vision platform, the average_hash(), dhash() and phash() functions are based on the 'ImageHash' python library and the Gabor Feature Extraction functions are based on 'Matlab' code of the paper, "CloudID: Trustworthy cloud-based and cross-enterprise biometric identification" by M. Haghighat, S. Zonouz, M. Abdel-Mottaleb, Expert Systems with Applications, vol. 42, no. 21, pp. 7905-7916, 2015, <doi:10.1016/j.eswa.2015.06.025>.
