Description: Incorporates functions for image preprocessing, filtering and image recognition. The package takes advantage of 'RcppArmadillo' to speed up computationally intensive functions. The histogram of oriented gradients descriptor is a modification of the 'findHOGFeatures' function of the 'SimpleCV' computer vision platform and the average_hash(), dhash() and phash() functions are based on the 'ImageHash' python library.
