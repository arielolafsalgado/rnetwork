Title: web tool for estimating under-five deaths caused by poor-quality
        antimalarials in sub-Saharan Africa
Description: This package allows users to calculate the number of
    under-five child deaths caused by consumption of poor quality
    antimalarials across 39 sub-Saharan nations. The package supports one
    function, that starts an interactive web tool created using
    the shiny R package. The web tool run's locally on the user's machine.
    The web tool allows users to set input parameters (prevalence of poor
    quality antimalarials, case fatality rate of children who take poor
    quality antimalarials, and sample size) which are then used to perform
    a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis following the Latin hypercube
    sampling scheme with calculation of partial rank correlation
    coefficients. Users can download the output figures as PDFs, and the
    output data as CSVs. Users can also download their input parameters
    for reference. This package was designed to accompany the analysis
    presented in:
