Version: 1.0.0
Author: Jonas Lieben
Maintainer: Jonas Lieben <jonas.lieben@uhasselt.be>
Description: Calculate several understandability metrics of BPMN models. BPMN stands for business process modelling notation and is a language for expressing business processes into business process diagrams. Examples of these understandability metrics are: average connector degree, maximum connector degree, sequentiality, cyclicity, diameter, depth, token split, control flow complexity, connector mismatch, connector heterogeneity, separability, structuredness and cross connectivity. See R documentation and paper on metric implementation included in this package for more information concerning the metrics.
