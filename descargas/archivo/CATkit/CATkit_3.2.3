Description: Calculates auto- and cross-correlation functions and plots an actogram and a smoothing function from a time series to identify and visualize periodic components. Tests presence of anticipated rhythm and estimates rhythm parameters; fits model consisting of multiple rhythmic components to data; performs least squares spectral analysis and other cosinor-based analyses, including population-mean cosinor (pmc).
