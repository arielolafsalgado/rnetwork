Description: The optR function provides an option to solve the linear system
    using numeric and non-meric approach. The current packages supports Gauss
    Elimination, LU decomposition, Gauss-Sideil, and CGM methods to solve
    equations having relationships of Ax=b form. The pacakge can be used to
    build linear and non-linear models by defining them in linear system.
