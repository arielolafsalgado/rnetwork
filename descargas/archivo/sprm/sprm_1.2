Description: Robust dimension reduction methods for regression and discriminant analysis are implemented that yield estimates with a partial least squares alike interpretability. Partial robust M regression (PRM) is robust to both vertical outliers and leverage points. Sparse partial robust M regression (SPRM) is a related robust method with sparse coefficient estimate, and therefore with intrinsic variable selection. For bianry classification related discriminant methods are PRM-DA and SPRM-DA.
