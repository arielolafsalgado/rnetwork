Description: Robust methods for dimension reduction and regression analysis are implemented that yield estimates with a partial least squares alike interpretability. Partial robust M regression is robust to both vertical outliers and leverage points. Sparse partial robust M regression is a related robust method with sparse coefficient estimate, and therefore with intrinsic variable selection.
