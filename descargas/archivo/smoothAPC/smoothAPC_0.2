Title: Smoothing of Two-Dimensional Demographic Data, Optionally Taking
        into Account Period and Cohort Effects
Author: Alexander Dokumentov, Rob J Hyndman
Maintainer: Alexander Dokumentov <alexander.dokumentov@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 3.2.2)
Imports: quantreg, SparseM, compiler, lmtest, stats, rgl, colorspace,
        methods
Description: The implemented method uses for smoothing bivariate thin plate
    splines, bivariate lasso-type regularization, and allows for both period
    and cohort effects. Thus the mortality rates are modelled as the sum of four
    components: a smooth bivariate function of age and time, smooth one-dimensional
    cohort effects, smooth one-dimensional period effects and random errors.
