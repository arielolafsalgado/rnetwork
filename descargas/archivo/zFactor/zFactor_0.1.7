Description: Computational algorithms to solve equations and find the
    compressibility factor `z` of hydrocarbon gases. Correlations available: 
    Hall-Yarborough, Dranchuk-AbuKassem, Dranchuk-Purvis-Robinson, Beggs-Brill, 
    Papp, Shell and an Artificial Neural Network correlation (Ann10) by Kamyab 
    et al. The package uses the original Standing-Katz chart for statistical 
    comparison and plotting. Applicable to sweet hydrocarbon gases for now.
