Description: RTextTools is a machine learning package for automatic
        text classification that makes it simple for novice users to
        get started with machine learning, while allowing experienced
        users to easily experiment with different settings and
        algorithm combinations. The package includes nine algorithms
        for ensemble classification (svm, slda, boosting, bagging,
        random forests, glmnet, decision trees, neural networks,
        maximum entropy), comprehensive analytics, and thorough
        documentation.
