Description: Piecewise constant hazard functions are used to flexibly model survival distributions with non-proportional hazards and 
	to simulate data from the specified distributions. Also, a function to calculate weighted log-rank tests for the 
	comparison of two hazard functions is included. Finally, a function to calculate a test using the maximum of a set of 
	test statistics from weighted log-rank tests is provided. This test utilizes the asymptotic multivariate normal joint distribution
	of the separate test statistics. The correlation is estimated from the data.
