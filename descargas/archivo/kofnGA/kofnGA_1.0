Description: Function kofnGA uses a genetic algorithm to choose a subset of a 
 fixed size k from the integers 1:n, such that a user-supplied objective function 
 is minimized at that subset.  The selection step is done by tournament selection 
 based on ranks, and elitism may be used to retain a portion of the best solutions 
 from one generation to the next.
