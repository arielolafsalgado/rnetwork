Description: A toolkit of tidy data manipulation verbs with 'data.table' as the backend.
  Combines the merits of syntax elegance from 'dplyr' and computing performance from 'data.table', 
  'tidyfst' intends to provide users with state-of-the-art data manipulation tools with least pain.
  This package is inspired by 'maditr', but follows a different philosophy of design, 
  such as prohibiting in place replacement and used a "_dt" suffix API.
  Also, 'tidyfst' would introduce more tidy data verbs from (and for) other packages,
  including but not limited to 'fst','tidyverse' and 'data.table'.
