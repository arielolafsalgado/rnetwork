Description: A collection of functions useful in learning and practicing IRT,
    which can be combined into larger programs. Provides basic CTT analysis,
    a simple common interface to the estimation of item
    parameters in IRT models for binary responses with three different programs
    (ICL, BILOG-MG, and ltm), ability estimation (MLE, BME, EAP, WLE, plausible 
    values), item and person fit statistics, scaling methods (MM, MS, Stocking-Lord,
    and the complete Hebaera method), and a rich array of parametric and 
    non-parametric (kernel) plots. Estimates and plots Haberman's interaction model
    when all items are dichotomously scored.
