Description: The development of this package 
       is now over, it is superseded by Momocs2 and more generally MomX ecosystem.
       The goal of Momocs is to provide a complete, convenient, 
       reproducible and open-source toolkit for 2D morphometrics.
       It includes most common 2D morphometrics approaches on outlines, open outlines, 
       configurations of landmarks, traditional morphometrics, and facilities for data preparation, 
       manipulation and visualization with a consistent grammar throughout.
       It allows reproducible, complex morphometrics analyses and other morphometrics approaches 
       should be easy to plug in, or develop from, on top of this canvas.
