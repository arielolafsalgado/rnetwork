Title: Adapt numerical records to fit (in)equality restrictions with
        the Successive Projection Algorithm
LazyData: no
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Mark van der Loo
Description: Based on (optionally sparse) quadratic optimization with the main
    algorithms implemented in C. Includes features for easy processing of many
    (smaller) records. The algorithm has been tested on fairly large
    optimization problems with up to a few million variables and several
    hundred thousand restrictions.
