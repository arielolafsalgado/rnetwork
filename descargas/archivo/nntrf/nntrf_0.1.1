Description: A supervised transformation of datasets is performed. 
    The aim is similar to that of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), that is, to carry out data transformation and dimensionality reduction, but in a non-linear supervised way. 
    This is achieved by first training a 3-layer Multi-Layer Perceptron and then using the activations of the hidden layer as a transformation of the input features.
    In fact, it takes advantage of the change of representation provided by the hidden layer of a neural network.
    This can be useful as data pre-processing for Machine Learning methods in general, specially for those that do not work well with many irrelevant or redundant features.
