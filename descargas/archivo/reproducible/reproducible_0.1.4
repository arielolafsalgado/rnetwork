Title: A Set of Tools that Enhance Reproducibility Beyond Package
        Management
Description: Built on top of 'git2r' and 'archivist', this package aims at
    making high-level, robust, machine and OS independent tools for making
    deeply reproducible and reusable content in R. This includes light weight
    package management (similar to 'packrat' and 'checkpoint', but more flexible,
    lightweight and simpler than both), plus it includes
    tools for caching, and accessing GitHub repositories.
