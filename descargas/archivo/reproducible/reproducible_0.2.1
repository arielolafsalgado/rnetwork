Title: A Set of Tools that Enhance Reproducibility Beyond Package
        Management
Description: Collection of high-level, robust, machine- and OS-independent tools
    for making deeply reproducible and reusable content in R.
    This includes light weight package management (similar to 'packrat' and
    'checkpoint', but more flexible, lightweight and simpler than both), tools
    for caching, downloading and verifying or writing checksums, post-processing 
    of common spatial datasets, and accessing GitHub repositories. 
    Some features are still under active development.
