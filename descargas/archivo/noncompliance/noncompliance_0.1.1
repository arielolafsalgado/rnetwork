Description: A finite-population significance test
    of the 'sharp' causal null hypothesis that
    treatment exposure X has no effect on final outcome Y,
    within the principal stratum of Compliers.
    A generalized likelihood ratio test statistic is used,
    and the resulting p-value is exact.
    Currently, it is assumed that there are only Compliers and Never Takers
    in the population.
