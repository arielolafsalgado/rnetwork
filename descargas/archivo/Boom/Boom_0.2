Author: Steven L. Scott is the sole author and creator of the BOOM
   project.  Some code in the BOOM libraries has been modified from
   other open source projects.  These include Cephes (obtained from
   Netlib, written by Stephen L. Moshier), NEWUOA (M.J.D Powell,
   obtained from Powell's web site), and a modified version of the R
   math libraries (R core development team).  Original copyright

Description: A C++ library for Bayesian modeling, with an emphasis on
   Markov chain Monte Carlo.  Although boom contains a few R utilities
   (mainly plotting functions), its primary purpose is to install the
   BOOM C++ library on your system so that other packages can link
   against it.
