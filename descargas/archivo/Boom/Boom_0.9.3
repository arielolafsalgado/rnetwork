Version: 0.9.3
Date: 2019-10-03
Title: Bayesian Object Oriented Modeling
Author: Steven L. Scott is the sole author and creator of the BOOM project.
   Some code in the BOOM libraries has been modified from other open source
   projects.  These include Cephes (obtained from Netlib, written by Stephen
   L. Moshier), NEWUOA (M.J.D Powell, obtained from Powell's web site), and a
   modified version of the R math libraries (R core development team).  Original
   copyright notices have been maintained in all source files.  In these cases,
   copyright claimed by Steven L. Scott is limited to modifications made to the
   original code.  Google claims copyright for code written while Steven
   L. Scott was employed at Google from 2008 - 2018, but BOOM is not an
   officially supported Google project.

Description: A C++ library for Bayesian modeling, with an emphasis on Markov
   chain Monte Carlo.  Although boom contains a few R utilities (mainly plotting
   functions), its primary purpose is to install the BOOM C++ library on your
   system so that other packages can link against it.
