Description: We implement multisite causal mediation analysis using the methods proposed by Qin and Hong (2017) <doi:10.3102/1076998617694879> and Qin, Hong, Deutsch, and Bein (under review). It enables causal mediation analysis in multisite trials, in which individuals are assigned to a treatment or a control group at each site. It allows for estimation and hypothesis testing for not only the population average but also the between-site variance of direct and indirect effects. This strategy conveniently relaxes the assumption of no treatment-by-mediator interaction while greatly simplifying the outcome model specification without invoking strong distributional assumptions. This package also provides a function that can further incorporate a sample weight and a nonresponse weight for multisite causal mediation analysis in the presence of complex sample and survey designs and non-random nonresponse, to enhance both the internal validity and external validity. Because the identification assumptions are not always warranted, the package also provides a weighting-based balance checking function for assessing the remaining overt bias, as well as a weighting-based sensitivity analysis function for further evaluating the potential bias related to omitted confounding or to propensity score model misspecification.
