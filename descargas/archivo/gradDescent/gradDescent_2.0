Description: An implementation of various learning algorithms based on Gradient Descent for dealing with regression tasks. 
	The variants of gradient descent algorithm are :
	Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MBGD), an optimization to use training data partially to reduce the computation load.
	Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), an optimization to use a random data in learning to reduce the computation load drastically.
	Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG), a SGD-based algorithm to minimize stochastic step to average.
	Momentum Gradient Descent (MGD), an optimization to speed-up gradient descent learning.
	Accelerated Gradient Descent (AGD), an optimization to accelerate gradient descent learning.
	Adagrad, a gradient-descent-based algorithm that accumulate previous cost to do adaptive learning.
	Adadelta, a gradient-descent-based algorithm that use hessian approximation to do adaptive learning.
	RMSprop, a gradient-descent-based algorithm that combine Adagrad and Adadelta adaptive learning ability.
	Adam, a gradient-descent-based algorithm that mean and variance moment to do adaptive learning.
