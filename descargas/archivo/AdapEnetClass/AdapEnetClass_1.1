Description: Provides new approaches to variable selection for censored data including its high-dimensionality, based on AFT models optimized using regularized weighted least squares. Approaches namely, a weighted elastic net, an adaptive elastic net, and two of their extensions by adding censoring observations as constraints into their model optimization frameworks are provided with both simulated and real (MCL) data examples.
