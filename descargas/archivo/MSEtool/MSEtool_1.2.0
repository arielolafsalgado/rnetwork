Description: Simulation tools for management strategy evaluation are provided for the 'DLMtool' operating model to inform data-rich fisheries. 
  'MSEtool' provides complementary assessment models of varying complexity with standardized reporting, diagnostic tools for evaluating 
  assessment models within closed-loop simulation, and helper functions for building more complex operating models and management procedures.
