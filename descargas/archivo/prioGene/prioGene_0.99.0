Description: In gene sequencing methods, the topological features of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are often
    used, such as ToppNet <https://toppgene.cchmc.org>. In this study, a candidate gene prioritization method was proposed for
    non-communicable diseases considering disease risks transferred between genes
    in weighted disease PPI networks with weights for
    nodes and edges based on functional information.
