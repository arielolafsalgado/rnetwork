Description: In gene sequencing methods, the topological features of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are 
    often used, such as ToppNet <https://toppgene.cchmc.org>. In this study, a candidate gene prioritization method
    was proposed for non-communicable diseases considering disease risks transferred between genes in weighted disease 
    PPI networks with weights for nodes and edges based on functional information.
