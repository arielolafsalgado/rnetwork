Description: Provides extensions for packages 'leaflet' & 'mapdeck', 
    many of which are used by package 'mapview'. 
    Focus is on functionality readily available in 
    Geographic Information Systems such as 'Quantum GIS'. Includes functions
    to display coordinates of mouse pointer position, query image values via 
    mouse pointer and zoom-to-layer buttons. Additionally, provides a feature 
    type agnostic function to add points, lines, polygons to a map.
