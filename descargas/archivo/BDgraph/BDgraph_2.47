Description: Provides statistical tools for Bayesian structure learning in undirected graphical models for continuous, discrete, and mixed data. The package is implemented the recent improvements in the Bayesian graphical models literature, including Mohammadi and Wit (2015) <https://doi:10.1214/14-BA889> and Mohammadi et al. (2017) <https://doi:10.1111/rssc.12171>. To speed up the computations, the BDMCMC sampling algorithms are implemented in parallel using OpenMP in C++.
