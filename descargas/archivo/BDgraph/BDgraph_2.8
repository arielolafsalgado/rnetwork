Description: This package provides a Bayesian methodology for structure learning in undirected graphical models. Our Bayesian methodology is based on birth-death Markov chain Monte Carlo (BDMCMC) algorithm which is the main function with the name 'bdgraph'. The main target of this package is high-dimensional data analysis wherein usually p >> n. The computation is memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output.
