Title: Crosstab and Statistical Tests for OII MSc Stats Course
Version: 1.0
Description: Provides simple crosstab output with optional statistics (e.g.,
    Goodman-Kruskal Gamma, Somers' d, and Kendall's tau-b) as well as two-way
    and one-way tables. The package is used within the statistics component of
    the Masters of Science (MSc) in Social Science of the Internet at the Oxford
    Internet Institute (OII), University of Oxford, but the functions should be
    useful for general data analysis and especially for analysis of categorical and
    ordinal data.
