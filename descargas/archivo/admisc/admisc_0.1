Description: Contains functions used across packages 'QCA', 'DDIwR', and 'venn'.
    Interprets and translates DNF - Disjunctive Normal Form expressions, for both
    binary and multi-value crisp sets, and extracts information (set names, set
    values) from those expressions. Other functions perform various other checks
    if possibly numeric (even if all numbers reside in a character vector) and
    coerce to numeric, or check if the numbers are whole. It also offers, among
    many others, a highly flexible recoding function.
