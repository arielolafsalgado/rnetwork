Description: Contains functions used across packages 'QCA', 'DDIwR', and 'venn'.
    Interprets and translates SOP - Sum of Products expressions, for both binary
    and multi-value crisp sets, and extracts information (set names, set values)
    from those expressions. Other functions perform various other checks if
    possibly numeric (even if all numbers reside in a character vector) and coerce
    to numeric, or check if the numbers are whole. It also offers, among others, a
    highly flexible recoding routine.
    Some functions need specific functionality from package QCA, but since that
    package depends on this one, admisc cannot automatically load it due to
    circular dependency.
