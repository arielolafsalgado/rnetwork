Description: Implements the probability density function, quantile function,
    cumulative distribution function, random number generation and the hazard rate function for
    the continuous one-parameter Lindley distribution as well as for 15 of its modifications. Also
    is it possible to draw censored random samples, with a desired censoring rate, when the event
    times are any continuous lifetime distribution supported by R.
