Authors@R: person("Jozef", "Hajnala", email = "jozef.hajnala@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Maintainer: Jozef Hajnala <jozef.hajnala@gmail.com>
Description: Allows to install the R 'languageserver' with all dependencies
    into a separate library and use that independent installation
    automatically when R is instantiated as a language server process.
    Useful for making language server seamless to use without
    running into package version conflicts.
