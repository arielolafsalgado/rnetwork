Description: Implements weighted estimation in Cox regression as proposed by
             Schemper, Wakounig and Heinze (Statistics in Medicine, 2009, <doi:10.1002/sim.3623>). Weighted Cox regression
             provides unbiased average hazard ratio estimates also in case of non-proportional hazards.
             Approximated generalized concordance probability an effect size measure for clear-cut
             decisions can be obtained.
             The package provides options to estimate time-dependent effects conveniently by
             including interactions of covariates with arbitrary functions of time, with or without
             making use of the weighting option.
