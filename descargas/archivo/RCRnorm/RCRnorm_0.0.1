Description: 'NanoString nCounter' is a medium-throughput platform that measures gene or microRNA expression levels. Here is a publication that introduces this platform: Malkov (2009) <doi:10.1186/1756-0500-2-80>. Here is the webpage of 'NanoString nCounter' where you can find detailed information about this platform <https://www.nanostring.com/scientific-content/technology-overview/ncounter-technology>. It has great clinical application, such as diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Implements integrated system of random-coefficient hierarchical regression model to normalize data from 'NanoString nCounter' platform so that noise from various sources can be removed.
