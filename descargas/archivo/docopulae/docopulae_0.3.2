Description: A direct approach to optimal designs for copula models based on the Fisher information. Provides flexible functions for building joint PDFs, evaluating the Fisher information and finding optimal designs. It includes an extensible solution to summation and integration called 'nint', functions for transforming, plotting and comparing designs, as well as a set of tools for common low-level tasks.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.2)
