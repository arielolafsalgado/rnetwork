Title: Access Reactive Data Interactively
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: person("Jake", "Riley", email = "rjake@sas.upenn.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Troubleshooting reactive data in 'shiny' can be difficult. These functions will convert reactive data frames into functions and load all assigned objects into your local environment. If you create a dummy input object, as the function will suggest, you will be able to test your server and ui functions interactively.
