Description: Provides a test of multivariate normality of an unknown sample 
    that does not require estimation of the nuisance parameters, the mean and covariance 
    matrix.  Rather, a sequence of transformations removes these nuisance parameters and
    results in a set of sample matrices that are positive definite.  These matrices are 
    uniformly distributed on the space of positive definite matrices in the unit 
    hyper-rectangle if and only if the original data is multivariate normal (Fairweather,
    1973, Doctoral dissertation, University of Washington). The package performs a 
    goodness of fit test of this hypothesis. In addition to the test, functions in the 
    package give visualizations of the support region of positive definite matrices for 
    bivariate samples.
