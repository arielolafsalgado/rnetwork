Description: Estimates the shape and volume of high-dimensional objects and performs set operations: intersection / overlap, union, unique components, inclusion test, and negative feature detection. Builds hypervolume representations of n-dimensional convex hulls (polytopes). Can measure the n-dimensional ecological hypervolume and perform species distribution modeling.
