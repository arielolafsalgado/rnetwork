Description: Estimates the shape and volume of high-dimensional datasets and performs set operations: intersection / overlap, union, unique components, inclusion test, and hole detection. Uses stochastic geometry approach to high-dimensional kernel density estimation. Builds n-dimensional convex hulls (polytopes). Can measure the n-dimensional ecological hypervolume and perform species distribution modeling.
