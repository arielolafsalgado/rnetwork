Title: Develop and Run Spatially Explicit Discrete Event Simulation
        Models
Description: Easily implement a variety of simulation models, with a focus on
    spatially explicit agent based models. These include raster-based,
    event-based, and agent-based models. The core simulation components are
    built upon a discrete event simulation framework that facilitates
    modularity, and easily enables the user to include additional functionality
    by running user-built simulation modules. Included are numerous tools to
    visualize raster and other maps. The suggested package `fastshp` can be
    installed with `install.packages("fastshp", repos="http://rforge.net",
    type="source")`.
