Title: Develop and Run Spatially Explicit Discrete Event Simulation
        Models
Description: Metapackage for implementing a variety of event-based models, with
    a focus on spatially explicit models. These include raster-based,
    event-based, and agent-based models. The core simulation components
    (provided by 'SpaDES.core') are built upon a discrete event simulation (DES;
    see Matloff (2011) ch 7.8.3 <https://nostarch.com/artofr.htm>)
    framework that facilitates modularity, and easily enables the user to
    include additional functionality by running user-built simulation modules
    (see also 'SpaDES.tools'). Included are numerous tools to visualize rasters
    and other maps (via 'quickPlot'), and caching methods for reproducible
    simulations (via 'reproducible'). Additional functionality is provided by
    the 'SpaDES.addins' and 'SpaDES.shiny' packages.
