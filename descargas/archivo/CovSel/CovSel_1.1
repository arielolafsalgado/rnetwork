Description: Model-free selection of covariates under unconfoundedness for situations where the parameter of interest is an average causal effect. This package is based on  model-free backward elimination algorithms proposed in de Luna, Waernbaum and Richardson (2011). Marginal co-ordinate hypothesis testing is used in situations where all covariates are continuous while kernel-based smoothing appropriate for mixed data is used otherwise.
