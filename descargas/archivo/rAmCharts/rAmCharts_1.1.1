Package: rAmCharts
Title: JavaScript Charts API Tool
Description: API for using 'AmCharts' Library. Based on the 'htmlwidgets'
    package, it provides a global architecture to generate 'JavaScript' source
    code for charts. Most of classes in the library have their equivalent in R
    with S4 classes; for those classes, not all properties have been referenced
    but can easily be added in the constructors. Complex properties (e.g.
    'JavaScript' object) can be passed as named list. See examples at <http://
    dataknowledge.github.io/rAmCharts/>. and <http://www.amcharts.com/> for more
    information about the library. The package includes the free version of 'AmCharts'
    Library. Its only limitation is that a small link to the web site will be
    displayed in your charts. If you enjoy this library, do not hesitate to refer
    to this page <http://www.amcharts.com/online-store/> to purchase a licence,
    and thus support its creators and get a period of Priority Support. See also
    <http://www.amcharts.com/about/> for more information about 'AmCharts' company.
