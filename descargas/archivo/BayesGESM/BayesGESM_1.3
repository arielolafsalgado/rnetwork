Description: It allows to perform the statistical inference based on the Bayesian approach for regression models under the assumption that independent additive errors follow normal, Student-t, slash, contaminated normal, Laplace or symmetric hyperbolic distributions, i.e., additive errors follow a scale mixtures of normal distributions. The regression models considered in this package are: (i) Generalized elliptical semi-parametric models, where both location and dispersion parameters of the response variable distribution include non-parametric additive components described by using B-splines; and (ii) Flexible measurement error models, which admit explanatory variables with and without measurement additive errors as well as the presence of nonlinear effects that are approximated by using B-splines.
