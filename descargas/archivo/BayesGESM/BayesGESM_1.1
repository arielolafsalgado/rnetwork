Description: This package allows obtain the statistical inference based on Bayesian approach for regression models under the assumption that independent additive errors follow normal, Student-t, slash, contaminated normal, Laplace or symmetric hyperbolic distribution, where both location and dispersion parameters of the response variable distribution include non-parametric additive components described by B-splines using the function BayesGESM and it also allows to obtain the statistical inference based on Bayesian approach for flexible measurement error models using the function fmem.
