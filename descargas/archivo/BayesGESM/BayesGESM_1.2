Description: This package allows to perform the statistical inference based on the Bayesian approach for regression models under the assumption that independent additive errors follow normal, Student-t, slash, contaminated normal, Laplace or symmetric hyperbolic distributions, i.e., additive errors follow a scale mixtures of normal distributions. The regression models considered in this package are: (i) Generalized elliptical semiparametric models, where both location and dispersion parameters of the response variable distribution include nonparametric additive components described by using B-splines; and (ii) Flexible measurement error models, which admit explanatory variables with and without measurement additive errors as well as the presence of a nonparametric component approximated by using B-splines.
