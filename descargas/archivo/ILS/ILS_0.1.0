Description: It performs interlaboratory studies (ILS) to detect those laboratories that provide non-consistent results when comparing to others.
  It permits to work simultaneously with various testing materials, from standard univariate, and functional data analysis (FDA) perspectives.
  The univariate approach based on ASTM E691-08 consist of estimating the Mandel's h and k statistics to identify those laboratories
  that provide more significant different results, testing also the presence of outliers by Cochran and Grubbs tests, Analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
  techniques are provided (F and Tuckey tests) to test differences in means corresponding to different laboratories per each material.
  Taking into account the functional nature of data retrieved in analytical chemistry, applied physics and engineering (spectra, thermograms, etc.).
  ILS package provides a FDA approach for finding the Mandel's k and h statistics distribution by smoothing bootstrap resampling.
