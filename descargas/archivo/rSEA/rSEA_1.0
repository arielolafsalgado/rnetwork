Description: SEA performs simultaneous feature-set testing for (gen)omics data. It tests the unified null hypothesis and controls the family-wise error rate for all possible pathways. The unified null hypothesis is defined as: "The proportion of true features in the set is less than or equal to a threshold." Family-wise error rate control is provided through use of closed testing with Simes test. There are some practical functions to make use of three databases for genomics, GO, Reactome and Wikipathways.
