Description: Functions for (1) simulating survival and recurrent event data from
    stochastic process point of view, (2) exploring and modeling recurrent event
    data through the mean cumulative function (MCF) or also called the
    Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard rate function, and gamma
    frailty model with spline rate function, and (3) comparing two-sample
    recurrent event responses with the pseudo-score tests.
