Description: Functions that fit gamma frailty model with spline or piecewise
    constant baseline rate function for recurrent event data, compute and
    plot parametric mean cumulative function (MCF) from a fitted model
    as well as nonparametric sample MCF (Nelson-Aalen estimator) are provided.
    Most functions are S4 methods that produce S4 class objects.
