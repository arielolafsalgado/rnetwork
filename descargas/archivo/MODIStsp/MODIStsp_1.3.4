Description: Allows automating the creation of time series of rasters derived
    from MODIS Satellite Land Products data. It performs several typical
    preprocessing steps such as download, mosaicking, reprojection and resize
    of data acquired on a specified time period. All processing parameters
    can be set using a user-friendly GUI. Users can select which layers of
    the original MODIS HDF files they want to process, which additional
    Quality Indicators should be extracted from aggregated MODIS Quality
    Assurance layers and, in the case of Surface Reflectance products
    , which Spectral Indexes should be computed from the original reflectance
    bands. For each output layer, outputs are saved as single-band raster
    files corresponding to each available acquisition date. Virtual files
    allowing access to the entire time series as a single file are also created.
    Command-line execution exploiting a previously saved processing options
    file is also possible, allowing to automatically update time series
    related to a MODIS product whenever a new image is available.
