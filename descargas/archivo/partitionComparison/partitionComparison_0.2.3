Description: Provides several measures ((dis)similarity, distance/metric,
    correlation, entropy) for comparing two partitions of the same set of
    objects. The different measures can be assigned to three different
    classes: Pair comparison (containing the famous Jaccard and Rand
    indices), set based, and information theory based.
    Many of the implemented measures can be found in
    Albatineh AN, Niewiadomska-Bugaj M and Mihalko D (2006)
    <doi:10.1007/s00357-006-0017-z> and
    Meila M (2007) <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2006.11.013>.
    Partitions are represented by vectors of class labels which allow a
    straightforward integration with existing clustering algorithms
    (e.g. kmeans()). The package is mostly based on the S4 object system.
