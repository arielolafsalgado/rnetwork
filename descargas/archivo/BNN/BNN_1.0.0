Description: Perform Bayesian variable selection for high-dimensional nonlinear systems and also can be used to test nonlinearity for a general regression problem. The computation can be accelerated using multiple CPUs. You can refer to Liang, F., Li, Q. and Zhou, L. (2017) at <https://www.samsi.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SAMSI_DPDA-Liang.pdf> for detail. The publication "Bayesian Neural Networks for Selection of drug sensitive Genes" will be appear on Journals of American Statistical Association soon.
