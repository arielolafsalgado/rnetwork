Description: Perform Bayesian variable selection for high-dimensional nonlinear systems and also can be used to test nonlinearity for a general regression problem. The computation can be accelerated using multiple CPUs. You can refer to Liang, F., Li, Q. and Zhou, L. (2017) at <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1409122> for more detail.
