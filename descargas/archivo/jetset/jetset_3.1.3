Description: On Affymetrix gene expression microarrays, a single gene may be measured by multiple probe sets. This can present a mild conundrum when attempting to evaluate a gene "signature" that is defined by gene names rather than by specific probe sets. This package provides a one-to-one mapping from gene to "best" probe set for four Affymetrix human gene expression microarrays: hgu95av2, hgu133a, hgu133plus2, and u133x3p. This package also includes the pre-calculated probe set quality scores that were used to define the mapping.
