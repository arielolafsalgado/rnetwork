Description: Our method automatically generates models of dynamic decision-making 
    that both have strong predictive power and are interpretable in human terms.
    We use an efficient model representation and a genetic algorithm-based
    estimation process to generate simple deterministic approximations that
    explain most of the structure of complex stochastic processes.
    We have applied the software to empirical data, and demonstrated it's 
    ability to recover known data-generating processes by simulating
    data with agent-based models and correctly deriving the underlying decision
    models for multiple agent models and degrees of stochasticity.
