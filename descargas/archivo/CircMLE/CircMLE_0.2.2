Description: A series of wrapper functions to
    implement the 10 maximum likelihood models of animal orientation
    described by Schnute and Groot (1992) <DOI:10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80068-5>. The
    functions also include the ability to use different optimizer
    methods and calculate various model selection metrics (i.e., AIC,
    AICc, BIC).
