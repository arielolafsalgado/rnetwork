Description: A series of wrapper functions to
    implement the 10 maximum likelihood models of animal orientation
    described by Schnute and Groot (1992) <DOI:10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80068-5>. The
    functions also include the ability to use different optimizer
    methods and calculate various model selection metrics (i.e., AIC,
    AICc, BIC).  The ability to perform variants of the Hermans-Rasson test and
    Pycke test is also included as described in Landler et al. (2019) 
    <DOI:10.1186/s12898-019-0246-8>.
