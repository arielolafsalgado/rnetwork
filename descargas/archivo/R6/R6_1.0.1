Package: R6
Title: Classes with reference semantics
Version: 1.0.1
Authors@R: "Winston Chang <winston@stdout.org> [aut, cre]"
Description: The R6 package allows the creation of classes with reference
    semantics, similar to R's built-in reference classes. Compared to reference
    classes, R6 classes are simpler and lighter-weight, and they are not built
    on S4 classes so they do not require the methods package. These classes
    allow public and private members, and they support inheritance.
