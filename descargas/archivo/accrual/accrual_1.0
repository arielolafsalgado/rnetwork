Description: Subject recruitment for medical research is challenging. Slow patient accrual leads to delay in research. Accrual monitoring during the process of recruitment is critical. Researchers need reliable tools to manage the accrual rate. We developed a Bayesian method that integrates researcher's experience on previous trials and data from the current study, providing reliable prediction on accrual rate for clinical studies. In this R package, we present functions for Bayesian accrual prediction which can be easily used by statisticians and clinical researchers.
