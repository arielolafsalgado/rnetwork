Description: Contains basic structures and operations used frequently in quantum
    computing. Intended to be a convenient tool to help in practicing the linear
    algebra involved in quantum operations. Has functionality for the creation of arbitrarily sized
    kets, bras, matrices and implements quantum gates, inner products, and tensor
    products. Can convert functions into equivalent quantum gates.
