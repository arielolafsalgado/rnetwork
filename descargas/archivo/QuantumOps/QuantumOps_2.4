Description: Contains basic structures and operations used frequently in quantum computing. Intended to be a convenient tool to help in practicing the linear algebra involved in quantum operations. Has functionality for the creation of arbitrarily sized kets, bras, matrices and implements quantum gates, inner products, and tensor products. Contains all commonly used quantum gates, creates arbitrarily controlled versions of all gates, and can simulate complete or partial measurements of kets. Implements modular arithmetic commonly found in quantum algorithms and can convert functions into equivalent quantum gates. It can also simulate larger applications, including the Quantum Fourier Transform developed by Shor (1999), Shor's algorithm which factors numbers up to 21, Grover's algorithm (1996), and the training of a quantum neural network developed by Schuld (2018) which can classify the MNIST dataset.
