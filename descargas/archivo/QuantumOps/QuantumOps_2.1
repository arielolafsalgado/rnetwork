Description: Contains basic structures and operations used frequently in quantum computing. Intended to be a convenient tool to help in practicing the linear algebra involved in quantum operations. Has functionality for the creation of arbitrarily sized kets, bras, matrices and implements quantum gates, inner products, and tensor products. Contains all commonly used quantum gates and the Quantum Fourier Transform developed by Shor (1999). Implements modular arithmetic commonly found in quantum algorithms and can convert functions into equivalent quantum gates.
