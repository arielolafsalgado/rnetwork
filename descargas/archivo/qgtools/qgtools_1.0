Description: Two linear mixed model approaches: REML(restricted maximum likelihood) and MINQUE (minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation) approaches and several resampling techniques are integrated for various quantitative genetics analyses. With these two types of approaches, various unbalanced data structures, missing data, and any irregular genetic  mating designs can be analyzed and statistically tested. This package also offers fast computations for many large data sets. Other functions will be added to this R tool in the future.
