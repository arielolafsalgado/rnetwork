Description: Functions to fit time-varying coefficient models for interval
	     censored and right censored survival data. Three major
	     approaches are implemented: 1) Bayesian Cox model with
	     time-independent, time-varying or dynamic coefficients for
	     right censored and interval censored data; 2) Spline based
	     time-varying coefficient Cox model for right censored data;
	     3) Transformation model with time-varying coefficients for
	     right censored data using estimating equations.
