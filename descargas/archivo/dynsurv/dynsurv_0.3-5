Description: Functions to fit time-varying coefficient models for interval
    censored and right censored survival data. Three major approaches are
    implemented: 1) Bayesian Cox model with time-independent, time-varying or
    dynamic coefficients for right censored and interval censored data; 2)
    Spline based time-varying coefficient Cox model for right censored data; 3)
    Transformation model with time-varying coefficients for right censored data
    using estimating equations.
