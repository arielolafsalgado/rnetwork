Description: Developed for computing the probability density function, computing the cumulative distribution function, computing the quantile function, random generation, and estimating the parameters of 24 G-family of statistical distributions via the maximum product spacing approach introduced in <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2345411>. The set of families contains: beta G distribution, beta exponential G distribution, beta extended G distribution, exponentiated G distribution, exponentiated exponential Poisson G distribution, exponentiated generalized G distribution, exponentiated Kumaraswamy G distribution, gamma type I G distribution, gamma type II G distribution, gamma uniform G distribution, gamma-X generated of log-logistic family of G distribution, gamma-X family of modified beta exponential G distribution, geometric exponential Poisson G distribution, generalized beta G distribution, generalized transmuted G distribution, Kumaraswamy G distribution, log gamma type I G distribution, log gamma type II G distribution, Marshall Olkin G distribution, Marshall Olkin Kumaraswamy G distribution, modified beta G distribution, odd log-logistic G distribution, truncated-exponential skew-symmetric G distribution, and Weibull G distribution.
