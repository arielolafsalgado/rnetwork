Description: Functions designed to connect disease-related differential proteins and 
  co-expression network. It provides the basic statics analysis included t test, ANOVA analysis. 
  The network construction is not offered by the package, you can used 'WGCNA' package which you 
  can learn in Peter et al. (2008) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-9-559>. It also provides module analysis 
  included PCA analysis, two enrichment analysis, Planner maximally filtered graph extraction and 
  hub analysis.
