Description: Implements the methods of McGrath et al. (in preparation) for 
    estimating the sample mean and standard deviation from commonly reported
    quantiles in meta-analysis. These methods can be applied to studies that 
    report the sample median, sample size, and one or both of (i) the sample 
    minimum and maximum values and (ii) the first and third quartiles.
