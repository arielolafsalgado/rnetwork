Description: Functions to calculate student growth percentiles and
        percentile growth projections/trajectories for students using
        large scale, longitudinal assessment data.  Functions use
        quantile regression to estimate the conditional density
        associated with each student's achievement history.  Percentile
        growth projections/trajectories are calculated using the
        coefficient matrices derived from the quantile regression
        analyses and specify what percentile growth is required for
        students to reach future achievement targets.
