Description: Functions to calculate growth percentiles and percentile
        growth projections/trajectories for students using large scale,
        longitudinal assessment data.  Functions use quantile
        regression to estimate the conditional density associated with
        each students achievement history.  Percentile growth
        projections/trajectories are calculated using the coefficient
        matrices derived from the quantile regression analyses and
        specify what percentile growth is required for students to
        reach future achievement targets.
