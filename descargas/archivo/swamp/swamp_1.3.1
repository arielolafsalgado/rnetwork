Description: Collection of functions to connect the structure of the data with the information on the samples. Three types of associations are covered: 1. linear model of principal components. 2. hierarchical clustering analysis. 3. distribution of features-sample annotation associations. Additionally, the inter-relation between sample annotations can be analyzed. Simple methods are provided for the correction of batch effects and removal of principal components.
