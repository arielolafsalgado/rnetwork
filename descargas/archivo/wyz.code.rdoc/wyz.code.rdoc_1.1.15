Title: Wizardry Code Offensive Programming R Documentation
Version: 1.1.15
Author: Fabien Gelineau <neonira@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Fabien Gelineau <neonira@gmail.com>
Description: Allows to generate automatically R documentation files from offensive 
    programming test cases. It populates most of the section of the documentation
    content from the offensive programming instrumentation. This reduces greatly the 
    package producer effort and time to get to a fully documented manual page for
    any instrumented function. Following documentation sections are now automatically
    filled from instrumentation data: title, description, usage, arguments, value, 
    author, examples. Sections references, notes and keyword are instrumented to
    industrialize their production. Produced manual pages are ready for completion
    (e.g note section if needed), language and phrasal adjustments. Main task for 
    the package producer is now review, no more content production.  Refer to 
    chapter 11 of Offensive Programming Book, Fabien GELINEAU (2019, 
    ISBN:979-10-699-4075-8), to learn about details and get value from this 
    package.
