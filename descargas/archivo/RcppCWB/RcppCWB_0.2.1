Description: 'Rcpp' Bindings for the C code of the 'Corpus Workbench' ('CWB'), an indexing and query 
  engine to efficiently analyze large corpora (<http://cwb.sourceforge.net>). 'RcppCWB' is licensed
  under the GNU GPL-3, in line with the GPL-3 license of the 'CWB' (<https://www.r-project.org/
  Licenses/GPL-3>). The 'CWB' relies on 'pcre' (BSD license, see <https://www.pcre.org/
  licence.txt>) and 'GLib' (LGPL license, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.
  html>). See the file LICENSE.note for further information. The package includes modified code of the
  'rcqp' package (GPL-2, see <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rcqp>). The original work of the authors
  of the 'rcqp' package is acknowledged with great respect, and they are listed as authors of this
  package. To achieve cross-platform portability (including Windows), using 'Rcpp' for wrapper code
  is the approach used by 'RcppCWB'.

NeedsCompilation: yes
SystemRequirements: On Unix-like operating systems, pcre (>= 7) and
        glib2 (>= 2) need to be present to compile 'RcppCWB'. See
        README.md for instructions how to install these dependencies.
        On Windows, no prior installations are necessary, as pre-built
        (i.e. cross-compiled) binaries of all required libraries are
        downloaded from a GitHub repository
        (<https://github.com/PolMine/libcl>) during installation.
