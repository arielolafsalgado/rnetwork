Description: This package contains tools for simulating alphanumeric alleles
    from parent-offspring pedigree databases to later reconstruct the
    corresponding non-recombinant haplotypes. Allelic simulations can be
    implemented taking into account many different factors (such as number of
    families, markers, alleles per marker, probability of missing genotypes,
    recombination rate, etc). Haplotype reconstruction can be performed even
    with missing data.
