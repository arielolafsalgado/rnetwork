Description: Easily and rapidly generate raster data in R, even for very large datasets, with an aesthetics-based mapping syntax that should be familiar to users of the 'ggplot2' package. While 'rasterly' does not attempt to reproduce the full functionality of the 'Datashader' graphics pipeline system for Python, the 'rasterly' API has several core elements in common with that software package.
