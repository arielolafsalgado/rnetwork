Description: In a linear regression setting, priors can be assigned to the regression function using a vector space framework, and the posterior estimate of the regression function obtained. I-priors are a class of such priors based on the principle of maximum entropy. While the main interest of I-prior modelling is prediction, inference is also possible, e.g. via log-likelihood ratio tests. This package supports both formula and non-formula based input. Estimation is mainly done via an EM algorithm, but there is flexibility in using any R optimiser to maximise the log-likelihood computed by the kernel loader function.
