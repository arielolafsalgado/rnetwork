Description: Estimation of the sample univariate, cross and return time extremograms. The package can also add empirical confidence bands to each of the extremogram plots via a permutation procedure under the assumption that the data are independent. Finally, the stationary bootstrap allows us to construct credible confidence bands for the extremograms.
