        'SQL'
Version: 1.0.0

Description: 
  Functions for vectorised conditional recoding of variables. case_when()
  enables you to vectorise multiple if and else statements (like 'CASE WHEN'
  in 'SQL'). if_else() is a stricter and more predictable
  version of ifelse() in 'base' that preserves attributes. These functions are 
  forked from 'dplyr' with all package dependencies removed and behave
  identically to the originals.
