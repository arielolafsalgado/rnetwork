Description: An implementation of Karaboga (2005) Artificial Bee Colony
    Optimization algorithm <http://mf.erciyes.edu.tr/abc/pub/tr06_2005.pdf>.
    This (working) version is a Work-in-progress, which is
    why it has been implemented using pure R code. This was developed upon the basic
    version programmed in C and distributed at the algorithm's official website.
