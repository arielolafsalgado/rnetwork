Description: Contains a suite of functions for survival analysis in health economics. These can be used to run survival models under a frequentist (based on maximum likelihood) or a Bayesian approach (both based on Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo). The user can specify a set of parametric models using a common notation and select the preferred mode of inference. The results can also be post-processed to produce probabilistic sensitivity analysis and can be used to export the output to an Excel file (e.g. for a Markov model, as often done by modellers and practitioners).
