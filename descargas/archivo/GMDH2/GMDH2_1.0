Description: Performs binary classification via Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) - type neural network algorithm. Also, it produces a well-formatted table of descriptives for a binary response. Moreover, it returns confusion matrix and related statistics and scatter plot with classification labels of binary classes to assess the prediction performance. All 'GMDH2' functions are designed for a binary response. See Dag O. and Yozgatligil C. (2016, ISSN:2073-4859) and Kondo T. and Ueno J. (2016, ISSN:1349-4198) for the details of GMDH algorithms.
