Description: Bindings to Google's C++ library Compact Language Detector 2
    (see <https://github.com/CLD2Owners/cld2#readme> for more information). Probabilistically
    detects over 80 languages in UTF-8 text (plain text or HTML). For mixed-language input it
    returns the top three languages and their approximate proportion of the total classified 
    text bytes (e.g. 80% English and 20% French out of 1000 bytes).
