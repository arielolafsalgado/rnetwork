Description: The Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) 
  is a ground segment of the European Organization for the Exploitation of 
  Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and one of EUMETSATs Satellite Application 
  Facilities. The CM SAF contributes to the sustainable observing of the climate 
  system by providing Essential Climate Variables related to the energy and water 
  cycle of the atmosphere (<http://www.cmsaf.eu>). It is a joint cooperation of seven 
  National Meteorological and Hydrological Services.
  The 'cmsaf' R-package provides a small collection of R-functions, which are 
  inspired by the Climate Data Operators ('cdo'). This gives the opportunity to  
  analyse and manipulate CM SAF data without the need of installing cdo. 
  The 'cmsaf' R-package is tested for CM SAF NetCDF data, which are structured 
  in three-dimensional arrays (longitude, latitude, time) on a rectangular grid. 
  Layered CM SAF data have to be converted with the provided 'levbox_mergetime()' 
  function. The 'cmsaf' R-package functions have only minor checks for deviations 
  from the recommended data structure, and give only few specific error messages. 
  Thus, there is no warranty of accurate results.
  Scripts for an easy application of the functions are provided at the CM SAF homepage 
  (<http://www.cmsaf.eu/EN/Products/Tools/Tools_node.html>).
