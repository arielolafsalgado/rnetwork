Description: The Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) 
  is a ground segment of the European Organization for the Exploitation of 
  Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and one of EUMETSATs Satellite Application 
  Facilities. The CM SAF contributes to the sustainable observing of the climate 
  system by providing essential climate variables related to the energy and water 
  cycle of the atmosphere (<http://www.cmsaf.eu>). It is a joint cooperation of seven 
  National Meteorological and Hydrological Services.
  The 'cmsaf' R-package provides a collection of R-operators for the analysis and 
  manipulation of CM SAF NetCDF formatted data. The 'cmsaf' R-package is tested 
  for CM SAF NetCDF data, which are structured in three-dimensional arrays 
  (longitude, latitude, time) on a rectangular grid. Layered CM SAF data have to 
  be converted with the provided levbox_mergetime() function. The 'cmsaf' R-package 
  operators have only minor checks for deviations from the recommended data structure, 
  and give only few specific error messages.
  Scripts for an easy application of the 'cmsaf' package operators and the preparation
  and visualization of CM SAF NetCDF data are provided at the CM SAF webpage 
  (<http://www.cmsaf.eu/EN/Products/Tools/Tools_node.html>).
