Description: Gaze data from the Visual World Paradigm requires significant
    preprocessing prior to plotting and analyzing the data. This package 
    provides functions for preparing visual world eye-tracking data for 
    statistical analysis and plotting. It can prepare data for either linear 
    analyses (e.g., ANOVA, Gaussian-family LMER, Gaussian-family GAMM) as
    well as logistic analyses (e.g., binomial-family LMER and binomial-family GAMM).
    Additionally, it contains a plotting function for creating grand average and
    conditional average plots. See the vignette for samples of the functionality.
    Currently, the functions in this package are designed for handling data
    collected with SR Research Eyelink eye trackers using Sample Reports created
    in SR Research Data Viewer; however, in subsequent releases we would like 
    to add functionality for data collected with Tobii and SMI systems.
