Description: This package is a programmatic interface to various SNP datasets
    on the web: openSNP, NBCI's dbSNP database, and Broad Institute SNP
    Annotation and Proxy Search. This package started as a library to
    interact with openSNP alone, so most functions deal with openSNP.
Title: Get SNP (Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism) data on the web.
