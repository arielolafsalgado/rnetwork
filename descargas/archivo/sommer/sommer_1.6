Description: Mixed model equation solver allowing the specification of variance covariance structures of random effects. ML/REML estimates are obtained using the Average Information, Expectation-Maximization, Newton-Raphson, or Efficient Mixed Model Association algorithms. Designed for genomic prediction and genome wide association studies (GWAS) to include additive, dominant and epistatic relationship structures or other covariance structures in R, but also functional as a regular mixed model program.
