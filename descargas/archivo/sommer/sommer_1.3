Description: Mixed model equation solver allowing the specification of variance covariance structures of random effects and residual structures. ML/REML estimates are obtained using the Average Information and/or Expectation-Maximization algorithms. Designed for genomic prediction and genome wide association studies (GWAS) to include additive, dominant and epistatic relationship structures.
