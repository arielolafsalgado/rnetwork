Title: Utilities for Generating SQL Queries from Model Objects
Description: Provides utilities for generating SQL queries (particularly CREATE
    TABLE statements) from R model objects. The most important use case is
    generating SQL to score a generalized linear model or related model
    represented as an R object, in which case the package handles parsing
    formula operators and including the model's response function.
