Title: R Utilities for Generating SQL Queries from Model Objects
Description: The sqlscore package provides utilities for generating SQL queries
    (particularly CREATE TABLE statements) from R model objects. The most important
    use case is generating SQL to score a generalized linear model or related model
    represented as an R object, in which case the package handles parsing formula
    operators and including the model's response function.
