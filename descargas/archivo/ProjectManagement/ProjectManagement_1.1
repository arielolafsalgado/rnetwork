Description: Management problems of deterministic and stochastic projects. It obtains the duration of a project and the appropriate slack for each activity in a deterministic context. In addition it obtains a schedule of activities' time (Castro, Gómez & Tejada (2007) <doi:10.1016/j.orl.2007.01.003>). When the project is done, and the actual duration for each activity is known, then it can know how long the project is delayed and make a fair delivery of the delay between each activity (Bergantiños, Valencia-Toledo & Vidal-Puga (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.dam.2017.08.012>). In a stochastic context it can estimate the average duration of the project and plot a histogram of this duration. As in the deterministic case, it can make a distribution of the delay generated by observing the project already carried out.
