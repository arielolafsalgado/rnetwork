Title: Proximity Catch Digraphs and Their Applications

Author: Elvan Ceyhan

Description: Contains the functions for generating patterns of segregation, association, CSR (complete spatial randomness)
    and Uniform data in one, two and three dimensional cases, for testing these patterns based on two invariants of
    various families of the proximity catch digraphs (PCDs) (see (Ceyhan (2005) ISBN:978-3-639-19063-2).
    The graph invariants used in testing spatial point data are the  domination number (Ceyhan (2011)
    <doi: 10.1080/03610921003597211>) and arc density (Ceyhan et al. (2006) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2005.03.002>;
    Ceyhan et al. (2007) <doi:10.1002/cjs.5550350106>) of for two-dimensional data  for visualization of PCDs for one,
    two and three dimensional data. The PCD families considered are Arc-Slice PCDs,
    Proportional-Edge PCDs and Central Similarity PCDs.
