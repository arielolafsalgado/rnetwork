Title: Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Peak Detection in ChIP-Seq
        Data
Description: A quadratic time dynamic programming algorithm
 can be used to compute an approximate solution to the problem of
 finding the most likely changepoints
 with respect to the Poisson likelihood, subject
 to a constraint on the number of segments, and the changes which must
 alternate: up, down, up, down, etc. For more info read

 proceedings of ICML2015.
Suggests: ggplot2 (>= 2.0), testthat, penaltyLearning
