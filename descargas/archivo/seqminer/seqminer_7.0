Description: Integrate sequencing data (Variant call format, e.g. VCF or BCF) or meta-analysis results in R. This package can help you (1) read VCF/BCF/BGEN files by chromosomal ranges (e.g. 1:100-200); (2) read RareMETAL summary statistics files; (3) read tables from a tabix-indexed files; (4) annotate VCF/BCF files; (5) create customized workflow based on Makefile.
Copyright: We have used the following software and made minimal
        necessary changes: tabix, Heng Li <lh3@live.co.uk> (MIT
        license), SQLite (Public Domain), Zstandard (MIT license). For
        tabix, we removed standard IO related functions, e.g. printf,
        fprintf ; also changed its un-safe pointer arithmetics. For
        zstandard, we removed compiler (clang, MSVC) specific
        preprocessing flags.
