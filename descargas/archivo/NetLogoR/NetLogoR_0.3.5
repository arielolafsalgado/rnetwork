Package: NetLogoR
Title: Build and Run Spatially Explicit Agent-Based Models
Description: Build and run spatially explicit
    agent-based models using only the R platform. 'NetLogoR' follows the same
    framework as the 'NetLogo' software
    (Wilensky, 1999 <http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/>) and is a translation
    in R of the structure and functions of 'NetLogo'.
    'NetLogoR' provides new R classes to define model agents and functions to
    implement spatially explicit agent-based models in the R environment.
    This package allows benefiting of the fast and easy coding phase from the
    highly developed 'NetLogo' framework, coupled with the versatility, power
    and massive resources of the R software.
    Examples of three models (Ants <http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Ants>,
    Butterfly (Railsback and Grimm, 2012) and Wolf-Sheep-Predation
    <http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WolfSheepPredation>) written using
    'NetLogoR' are available. The 'NetLogo' code of the original version of these
    models is provided alongside.
    A programming guide inspired from the 'NetLogo' Programming Guide
    (<https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html>) and a dictionary
    of 'NetLogo' primitives (<https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html>)
    equivalences are also available.
    NOTE: To increment 'time', these functions can use a for loop or can be
    integrated with a discrete event simulator, such as 'SpaDES'
    (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=SpaDES>).
    The suggested package 'fastshp' can be installed with
    'install.packages("fastshp", repos = "https://rforge.net", type = "source")'.
