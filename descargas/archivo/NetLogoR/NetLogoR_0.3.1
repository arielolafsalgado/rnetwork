Package: NetLogoR
Title: A Port of 'NetLogo' Functions and Language to R
Description: Easily create agent-based models in R following the 'NetLogo'
    framework (Wilensky, 1999; <http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/>).
    'NetLogoR' provides classes to represent 'patches' (raster cells) and
    'turtles' (individuals), the necessary 'NetLogo' primitives
    (<https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html>), and
    complementary functions to easily build agent-based models or translate
    'NetLogo' models in R. A programming guide derived from the 'NetLogo'
    Programming Guide
    (<https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html>) and a
    dictionary of 'NetLogo' primitives
    (<https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html>) equivalences
    are available. As examples, three 'NetLogo' models (Ants,
    <http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Ants>; Butterfly, Railsback and
    Grimm, 2012; Wolf-Sheep-Predation,
    <http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WolfSheepPredation>) were
    translated in R language using 'NetLogoR'. NOTE: To increment 'time', these
    functions can use a for loop or can be integrated with a discrete event
    simulator, such as 'SpaDES' (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=SpaDES>).
    The suggested package 'fastshp' can be installed with
    'install.packages("fastshp", repos = "http://rforge.net", type = "source")'.
