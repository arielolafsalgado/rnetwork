Description: The Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design is a novel phase I clinical trial design for finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The BOIN design is motivated by the top priority and concern of clinicians when testing a new drug, which is to effectively treat patients and minimize the chance of exposing them to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses. The prominent advantage of the BOIN design is that it achieves simplicity and superior performance at the same time. The BOIN design is algorithm-based and can be implemented in a simple way similar to the traditional 3+3 design. The BOIN design yields average performance comparable to the continual reassessment method (CRM, one of the best model-based design) in terms of selecting the MTD, but has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses.
