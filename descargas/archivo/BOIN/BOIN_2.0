Description: The Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design is a novel phase I clinical trial design for finding
    the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). It can be used to design both single-agent and
    drug-combination trials. The BOIN design is motivated by the top priority and concern of
    clinicians when testing a new drug, which is to effectively treat patients and minimize the chance
    of exposing them to subtherapeutic or overly toxic doses. The prominent advantage of the
    BOIN design is that it achieves simplicity and superior performance at the same time.
    The BOIN design is algorithm-based and can be implemented in a simple way similar to the
    traditional 3+3 design. The BOIN design yields an average performance that is comparable to
    that of the continual reassessment method (CRM, one of the best model-based designs) in terms of
    selecting the MTD, but has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic
    or overly toxic doses.
