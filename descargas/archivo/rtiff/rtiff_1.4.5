Description: Reads and writes TIFF format images and
        returns them as a pixmap object. Because the resulting object
        can be very large for even modestly sized TIFF images, images
        can be reduced as they are read for improved performance.  This
        package is a wrapper around libtiff (www.libtiff.org), on which
        it depends (i.e. the libtiff shared library must be on your
        PATH for the binary to work, and tiffio.h must be on your
        system to build the package from source). By using libtiff's
        highlevel TIFFReadRGBAImage function, this package inherently
        supports a wide range of image formats and compression schemes.
        This package also provides an implementation of the Ridler
        Autothresholding algorithm for easy generation of binary masks.
