Description: This is a shape preserving spline which is guaranteed
    to be monotonic and concave or convex if the data is monotonic
    and concave or convex. It does not use any optimisation and is
    therefore quick and smoothly converges to a fixed point in
    economic dynamics problems including value function iteration.
    It also automatically gives the first two derivatives of the
    spline and options for determining behaviour when evaluated
    outside the interpolation domain.
