Description: 'TensorFlow' Hub is a library for the publication, discovery, and
    consumption of reusable parts of machine learning models. A module is a 
    self-contained piece of a 'TensorFlow' graph, along with its weights and 
    assets, that can be reused across different tasks in a process known as
    transfer learning. Transfer learning train a model with a smaller dataset,
    improve generalization, and speed up training.
