Description: Making it easy to use various types of fonts ('TrueType',
    'OpenType', Type 1, web fonts, etc.) in R graphs, and supporting most output
    formats of R graphics including PNG, PDF and SVG. Text glyphs will be converted
    into polygons or raster images, hence after the plot has been created, it no
    longer relies on the font files. No external software such as Ghostscript is
    needed to use this package.
