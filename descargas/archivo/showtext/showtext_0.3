Version: 0.3
Date: 2015-03-10
Author: Yixuan Qiu and authors/contributors of the
    included software. See file AUTHORS for details.
Maintainer: Yixuan Qiu <yixuan.qiu@cos.name>
Description: Making it easy to use various types of fonts
    (TrueType, OpenType, Type 1, web fonts, etc.) in R graphs, and
    supporting most output formats of R graphics including PNG, PDF and
    SVG. Fonts will be embedded in the graph file, hence after the plot
    has been created, it no longer relies on the font files.
    No external software such as Ghostscript is needed to use this package.
