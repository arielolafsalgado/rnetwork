Description: This package can override text rendering functions of many
    R graphics devices (such as svg(), pdf(), etc.), so that text in R
    graphs can be displayed or printed using almost any system fonts.
    This is done by analyzing the glyphs contained in the font file and
    then rendering the text into lines and polygons, which are all device
    independent. This package will be helpful if you want to use non-standard
    fonts in your graphics device (for example, drawing Chinese characters in
    pdf device).
