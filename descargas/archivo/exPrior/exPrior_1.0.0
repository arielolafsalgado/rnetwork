Description: The aim of this package is to provide practitioners of statistics in
  geology, hydrology, etc. a tool to derive prior distributions for Bayesian 
  inference. Prior distributions summarize knowledge from studies at similar sites. 
  The main features of the package are to (i) generate prior distributions based 
  on external data only; (ii) to account for possible autocorrelation
  in the data, and (iii) to account for available soft data, say, in 
  the form of expert information on bounds and moments.
