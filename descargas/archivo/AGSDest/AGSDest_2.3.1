Description: Calculation of repeated confidence intervals as well as confidence
    intervals based on the stage-wise ordering in group sequential designs and
    adaptive group sequential designs. For adaptive group sequential designs
    the confidence intervals are based on the conditional rejection probability
    principle. Currently the procedures do not support the use of futility
    boundaries or more than one adaptive interim analysis.
