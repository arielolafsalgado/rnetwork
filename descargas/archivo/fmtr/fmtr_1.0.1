Title: Easily Apply Formats to Data
Version: 1.0.1
Author: David Bosak
Maintainer: David Bosak <dbosak01@gmail.com>
Description: Contains a set of functions that can be used to apply
  formats to data frames or vectors.  The package aims to provide to R
  functionality similar to that of SAS® formats. Formats are assigned to
  the format attribute on data frame columns.  Then when the fdata() 
  function is called, a new data frame is created with the column data
  formatted as specified.  The package also contains a value() function
  to create a user-defined format, similar to a SAS® user-defined format.
