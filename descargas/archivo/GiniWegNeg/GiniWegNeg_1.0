Description: Computation of the Gini coefficient in the presence of weighted and/or negative attributes. Two different approaches are considered in order to fulfill, in the case of negative attributes, the normalization principle, that is a value of the Gini coefficient bounded into the close range [0,1]. The first approach is based on the proposal by Chen, Tsaur and Rhai (1982) and Berebbi and Silber (1985), while the second approach is based on a recent proposal by Raffinetti, Siletti and Vernizzi (2015). The plot of the curve of maximum inequality, defined in the contribution of Raffinetti, Siletti and Vernizzi (2015), is provided.
