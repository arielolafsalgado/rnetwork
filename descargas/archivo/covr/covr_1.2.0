Package: covr
Title: Test Coverage for Packages
Version: 1.2.0
Authors@R: person("Jim", "Hester", email = "james.f.hester@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Track and report code coverage for your package and (optionally)
    upload the results to a coverage service like Codecov (http://codecov.io)
    or Coveralls (http://coveralls.io).  Code coverage is a measure of the
    amount of code being exercised by the tests.  It is an indirect measure of
    test quality. This package is compatible with any testing methodology or
    framework and tracks coverage of both R code and compiled C/C++/Fortran code.
