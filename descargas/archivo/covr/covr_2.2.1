Description: Track and report code coverage for your package and (optionally)
    upload the results to a coverage service like 'Codecov' (http://codecov.io) or
    'Coveralls' (http://coveralls.io). Code coverage is a measure of the amount of
    code being exercised by a set of tests. It is an indirect measure of test
    quality and completeness. This package is compatible with any testing
    methodology or framework and tracks coverage of both R code and compiled
    C/C++/FORTRAN code.
