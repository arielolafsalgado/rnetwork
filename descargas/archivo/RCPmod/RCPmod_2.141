Title: Regions of Common Profiles Modelling with Mixtures-of-Experts
Author: Scott D. Foster
Maintainer: Scott Foster <scott.foster@csiro.au>
Imports: glmnet, fishMod, MASS, gtools, parallel, stats, graphics
Description: Identifies regions of common (species) profiles (RCPs), possibly when sampling artefacts are present.  Within a region the probability of sampling all species remains approximately constant.  This is performed using mixtures-of-experts models.  The package also contains associated methods, such as diagnostics.
