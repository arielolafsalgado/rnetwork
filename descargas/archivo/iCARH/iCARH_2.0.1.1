Description: Implements the integrative conditional autoregressive horseshoe model 
    discussed in Jendoubi, T., & Ebbels, T. (2018). "Integrative analysis of 
    time course metabolic data and biomarker discovery". arXiv preprint <arXiv:1801.07767>.
    The model consists in three levels: Metabolic pathways level modeling interdependencies between
    variables via a conditional auto-regressive (CAR) component , integrative analysis level to identify
    potential associations between heterogeneous omic variables via a Horseshoe prior and experimental
    design level to capture experimental design conditions through a mixed-effects model.
    The package also provides functions to simulate data from the model, construct pathway matrices,
    post process and plot model parameters.
