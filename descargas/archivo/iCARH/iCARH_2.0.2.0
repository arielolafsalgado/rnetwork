Description: Implements the integrative conditional autoregressive horseshoe model 
    discussed in Jendoubi, T., Ebbels, T.M. Integrative analysis of time course metabolic data and biomarker discovery. 
    BMC Bioinformatics 21, 11 (2020) <doi:10.1186/s12859-019-3333-0>.
    The model consists in three levels: Metabolic pathways level modeling interdependencies between
    variables via a conditional auto-regressive (CAR) component, integrative analysis level to identify
    potential associations between heterogeneous omic variables via a Horseshoe prior and experimental
    design level to capture experimental design conditions through a mixed-effects model.
    The package also provides functions to simulate data from the model, construct pathway matrices,
    post process and plot model parameters.
