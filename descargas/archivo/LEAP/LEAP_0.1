Description: Advances in sequencing technology now allow researchers to capture the expression profiles of individual cells. Several algorithms have been developed to attempt to account for these effects by determining a cell's so-called `pseudotime', or relative biological state of transition. By applying these algorithms to single-cell sequencing data, we can sort cells into their pseudotemporal ordering based on gene expression. LEAP (Lag-based Expression Association for Pseudotime-series) then applies a time-series inspired lag-based correlation analysis to reveal linearly dependent genetic associations.
