Description: Hierarchical continuous time state space modelling, for linear
    and nonlinear systems measured by  continuous variables, with limited support for 
    binary data. The subject specific dynamic system is modelled as a stochastic 
    differential equation (SDE), measurement models are typically multivariate normal factor models. 
    Using the original ctsem formulation based on OpenMx, described in the JSS paper 
    "Continuous Time Structural Equation Modeling with R Package ctsem", with updated version
    as CRAN vignette <https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctsem/vignettes/ctsem.pdf> ,
    linear mixed effects SDE's estimated via maximum likelihood and optimization are possible.
    Using the Stan based formulation, described in <https://github.com/cdriveraus/ctsem/raw/master/vignettes/hierarchicalmanual.pdf> , 
    nonlinearity (state dependent parameters) and random effects on all parameters
    are possible, using either optimization (with optional importance sampling) or
    Stan's Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Priors may be used. For the conceptual
    overview of the hierarchical Bayesian linear SDE approach, see <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324093594_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Continuous_Time_Dynamic_Modeling>.
    Exogenous inputs may also be included, for an overview of such possibilities see <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328221807_Understanding_the_Time_Course_of_Interventions_with_Continuous_Time_Dynamic_Models> .
    Stan based functions are not available on 32 bit Windows systems at present.
