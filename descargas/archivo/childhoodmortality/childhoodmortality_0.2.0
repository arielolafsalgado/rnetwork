Description: Calculates childhood (neonatal, postneonatal, infant, child, and under-five) mortality rates using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) microdata.
    The 'childhoodmortality' package was developed in accordance to the methodology outlined in the "DHS Guide to Statistics" (Rutstein 2006,
    <http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/DHSG1/Guide_to_DHS_Statistics_29Oct2012_DHSG1.pdf>) Specifically, the package uses a synthetic cohort
    life table approach, combining mortality probabilities for age segments with actual cohort mortality experience into more common age
    segments. Standard errors for mortality estimates are computed using the jackknife repeated replication method outlined in the "Estimates of Sampling Errors"
    appendix of DHS Final Reports (DHS 2004, <http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR175/19AppendixB.pdf>). This methodology controls for sample design.
