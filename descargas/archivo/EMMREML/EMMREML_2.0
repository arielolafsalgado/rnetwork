Description: The main functions are emmreml, and emmremlMultiKernel.emmreml solves a mixed model with known covariance structure using the EMMA algorithm . emmremlMultiKernel is a wrapper for emmreml to handle multiple random components with known covariance structures. The function emmremlMultivariate solves a multivariate gaussian mixed model with known covariance structure using the ECM algorithm.
