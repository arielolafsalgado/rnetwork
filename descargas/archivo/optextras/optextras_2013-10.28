Description: Tools to assist in safely applying user-generated objective and 
   derivative functions to optimization programs. "Optimization" at the 
   time of writing refers primarily to function minimization methods with at most 
   bounds and masks on the parameters.
   Tools are provided to check the basic computation of objective functions that 
   the user provides, along with proposed gradient and Hessian functions, 
   as well as to wrap such functions to avoid failures when inadmissible parameters 
   are provided. Checks on bounds and masks (fixed parameters) are available, as
   are a check on scaling or optimality conditions. An axial search to seek lower
   points on the objective function surface is included. Though numDeriv is
   used as the primary tool for numerical derivative approximations, forward, 
   central and backward gradient approximation codes for convenience.
