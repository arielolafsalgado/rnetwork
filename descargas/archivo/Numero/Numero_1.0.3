Description: High-dimensional datasets that do not exhibit a clear intrinsic clustered structure pose a challenge to conventional clustering algorithms. For this reason, we developed an unsupervised framework that helps scientists to better subgroup their datasets based on visual cues [Makinen V-P et al. (2011) J Proteome Res 11:1782-1790, <doi:10.1021/pr201036j>]. The framework includes the necessary functions to import large data files, to construct a self-organizing map of the data, to evaluate the statistical significance of the observed data patterns, and to visualize the results in scalable vector graphics.
