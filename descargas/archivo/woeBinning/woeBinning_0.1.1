Description: Implements an automated fine and coarse classing to bin numeric
 variables and factors with respect to a dichotomous target variable.
 Numeric variables are binned by merging a specified initial number of bins with
 similar frequencies. As a start sparse bins are merged with adjacent ones.
 Afterwards nearby bins with most similar WOE values are joined step by step until
 the information value (IV) decreases more than specified by a percentage value.
 Factors are binned by merging factor levels. At the beginning sparse levels are
 merged to a 'miscellaneous' level. Afterwards bins with most similar WOE values
 are joined step by step until the IV decreases more than specified by a percentage
 value.
 The package can be used with single variables or an entire data frame. It provides
 flexible tools for exploring different binning solutions and for deploying them to
 (new) data.
