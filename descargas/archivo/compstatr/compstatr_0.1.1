Description: Provides a set of tools for creating yearly data sets of St. Louis 
    Metropolitan Police Department (SLMPD) crime data, which are available from
    January 2008 onward as monthly CSV releases on their website 
    (<http:www.slmpd.org/Crimereports.shtml>). Once data are validated and created 
    (monthly data releases have varying numbers of columns 
    as well as different column names and formats), 'compstatr' also provides 
    functions for categorizing and mapping crimes in St. Louis. The categorization 
    tools that are provided will also work with any police department that uses 5 
    and 6 digit numeric codes to identify specific crimes. These data provide researchers
    and policy makers detailed data for St. Louis, which in the last several years 
    has had some of the highest or the highest violent crime rates in the United States.
