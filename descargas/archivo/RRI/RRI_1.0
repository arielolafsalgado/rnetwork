Title: Residual Randomization Inference for Regression Models
Version: 1.0
Author: Panos Toulis
Maintainer: Panos Toulis <panos.toulis@chicagobooth.edu>
Description: Testing and inference for regression models using residual randomization methods. The basis of inference is an invariance assumption on the regression errors. This includes cluster errors, and exchangeability within clusters or sign symmetry across clusters.
