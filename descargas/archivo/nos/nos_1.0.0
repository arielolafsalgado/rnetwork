Title: Compute Node Overlap and Segregation in Ecological Networks
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Thomas J. Matthews and Giovanni Strona
Maintainer: Thomas J. Matthews <txm676@gmail.com>
Description: Calculate NOS (node overlap and segregation) and 
    the associated metrics described in Strona and 
    Veech (2015) <DOI:10.1111/2041-210X.12395> and Strona et al. 
    (2017; In Press, DOI to be provided in subsequent package version). 
    The functions provided in the package enable assessment of 
    structural patterns ranging from complete node segregation to perfect 
    nestedness in a variety of network types. In addition, they provide a 
    measure of network modularity.
