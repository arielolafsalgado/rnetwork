Title: Implementation of the 3D Alpha-Shape for the Reconstruction of
        3D Sets from a Point Cloud

Description: Implementation in R of the alpha-shape of a finite set of points in the three-dimensional space. The alpha-shape generalizes the convex hull and allows to recover the shape of non-convex and even non-connected sets in 3D, given a random sample of points taken into it. Besides the computation of the alpha-shape, this package provides users with functions to compute the volume of the alpha-shape, identify the connected components and facilitate the three-dimensional graphical visualization of the estimated set.
