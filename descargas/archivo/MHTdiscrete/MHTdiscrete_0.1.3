Description: A Comprehensive tool for almost all existing multiple testing
    methods for discrete data. The package also provides some novel multiple testing
    procedures controlling FWER/FDR for discrete data. Given discrete p-values
    and their domains, the [method].p.adjust function returns adjusted p-values,
    which can be used to compare with the nominal significant level alpha and make
    decisions. For users' convenience, the functions also provide the output option 
    for printing decision rules.
