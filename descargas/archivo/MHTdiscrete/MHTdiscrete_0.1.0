Description: A Comprehensive tool for almost all existing multiple testing methods for discrete data. The package also provides some novel multiple testing procedures controlling
    FWER/FDR for discrete data. In order to make decisions conveniently,  given discrete p-values and their domains, the [method].p.adjust function returns adjusted p-values, which can be used to compare with the nominal significant level alpha.
