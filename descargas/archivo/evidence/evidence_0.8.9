Description: Bayesian (and some likelihoodist) functions as alternatives to hypothesis-testing functions in R base using a user interface patterned after those of R's hypothesis testing functions. See McElreath (2016, ISBN: 978-1-4822-5344-3), Gelman and Hill (2007, ISBN: 0-521-68689-X) (new edition in preparation) and Albert (2009, ISBN: 978-0-387-71384-7) for good introductions to Bayesian analysis and Pawitan (2002, ISBN: 0-19-850765-8) for the Likelihood approach.  The functions in the package also make extensive use of graphical displays for data exploration and model comparison.
