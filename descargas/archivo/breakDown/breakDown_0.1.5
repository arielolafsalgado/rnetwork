Description: Break Down Plots are inspired by waterfall plots created by 'xgboostExplainer' package
    (see <https://github.com/AppliedDataSciencePartners/xgboostExplainer>). 
    The idea behind Break Down Plots it to decompose model prediction for a single observation. 
    Break Down Plots show the contribution of every variable present in the model. 
    Such plots will work for binary classifiers and general regression models.
