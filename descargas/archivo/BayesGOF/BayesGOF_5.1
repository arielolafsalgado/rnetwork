Author: Subhadeep Mukhopadhyay, Douglas Fletcher
Maintainer: Doug Fletcher <tug25070@temple.edu>
Description: A Bayesian data modeling scheme that performs four interconnected tasks: (i) characterizes the uncertainty of the elicited parametric prior; (ii) provides exploratory diagnostic for checking prior-data conflict; (iii) computes the final statistical prior density estimate; and (iv) executes macro- and micro-inference. Primary reference is Mukhopadhyay, S. and Fletcher, D. 2018 paper "Generalized Empirical Bayes via Frequentist Goodness of Fit" (<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28130-5 >).
