Description: Non-parametric method for learning prior distribution starting with parametric (subjective) prior.  It performs four interconnected tasks: (i) characterizes the uncertainty of the elicited prior; (ii) exploratory diagnostic for checking prior-data conflict; (iii) computes the final statistical prior density estimate; and (iv) performs macro- and micro-inference. Primary reference is Mukhopadhyay, S. and Fletcher, D. (2017, Technical Report).
