Description: This package provides functions to generate a correlation matrix
    from a genetic dataset and to use this matrix to predict the phenotype of an
    individual by using the phenotypes of the remaining individuals through
    kriging. Kriging is a geostatistical method for optimal prediction or best
    unbiased linear prediction. It consists of predicting the value of a
    variable at an unobserved location as a weighted sum of the variable at
    observed locations. Intuitively, it works as a reverse linear regression:
    instead of computing correlation (univariate regression coefficients are
    simply scaled correlation) between a dependent variable Y and independent
    variables X, it uses known correlation between X and Y to predict Y.
