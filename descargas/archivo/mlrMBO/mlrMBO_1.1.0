Title: A Toolbox for Model-Based Optimization of Expensive Black-Box
        Functions
Description: Flexible and comprehensive R toolbox for model-based optimization
    ('MBO'), also known as Bayesian optimization. It is designed for both single-
    and multi-objective optimization with mixed continuous, categorical and
    conditional parameters. The machine learning toolbox 'mlr' provide dozens
    of regression learners to model the performance of the target algorithm with
    respect to the parameter settings. It provides many different infill criteria
    to guide the search process. Additional features include multipoint batch
    proposal, parallel execution as well as visualization and sophisticated
    logging mechanisms, which is especially useful for teaching and understanding
    of algorithm behavior. 'mlrMBO' is implemented in a modular fashion, such that
    single components can be easily replaced or adapted by the user for specific use
    cases.
