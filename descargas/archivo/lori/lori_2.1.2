Description: Analysis, imputation, and multiple imputation of count data using covariates. LORI uses a log-linear model where main row and column effects are decomposed as regression terms on known covariates. A residual low-rank interaction term is also fitted. LORI returns estimates of covariate effects and interactions, as well as an imputed count table. The package also contains a multiple imputation procedure.
