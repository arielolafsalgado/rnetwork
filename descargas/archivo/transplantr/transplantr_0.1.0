Description: A set of vectorised functions to calculate medical equations used in transplantation, 
    focused mainly on transplantation of abdominal organs. These functions include donor and recipient
    risk indices as used by NHS Blood & Transplant, OPTN/UNOS and Eurotransplant, tools for 
    quantifying HLA mismatches, functions for calculating estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 
    a function to calculate the APRI score used in initial screening of suitability to receive a 
    transplant from a hepatitis C seropositive donor and some biochemical unit converter functions. 
    All functions are designed to work with either US or international units.
    References for the equations are provided in the vignettes and function documentation.
