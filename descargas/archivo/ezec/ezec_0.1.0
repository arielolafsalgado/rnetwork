Description: Because fungicide resistance is an important phenotypic trait for
    fungi and oomycetes, it is necessary to have a standardized method of
    statistically analyzing the Effective Concentration (EC) values. This
    package is designed for those who are not terribly familiar with R to be
    able to analyze and plot an entire set of isolates using the drc package.
