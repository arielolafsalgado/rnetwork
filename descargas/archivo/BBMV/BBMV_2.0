Description: Provides a set of functions to fit general macroevolutionary models for continuous traits evolving in adaptive landscapes of any shape. This package implements the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov model (FPK), in which the trait evolves under random diffusion but is also subject to a force that pulls it towards specific values - this force can be of any shape. FPK has a version in which hard reflective bounds exist at the extremes of the trait interval: this second model is called BBMV.
