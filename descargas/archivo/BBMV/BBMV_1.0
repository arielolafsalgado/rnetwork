Description: Provides a set of functions to fit general macroevolutionary models for continuous traits evolving in adaptive landscapes of any shape. The model is based on bounded Brownian motion (BBM), in which a continuous trait evolves along a phylogenetic tree under constant-rate diffusion between two reflective bounds. In addition to this random component, the trait evolves in a potential and is thus subject to a force that pulls it towards specific values - this force can be of any shape.
