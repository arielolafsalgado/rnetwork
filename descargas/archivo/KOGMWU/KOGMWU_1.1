Description: Rank-based tests for enrichment of KOG (euKaryotic Orthologous Groups) classes with up- or down-regulated genes based on a continuous measure. The meta-analysis is based on correlation of KOG delta-ranks across datasets (delta-rank is the difference between mean rank of genes belonging to a KOG class and mean rank of all other genes). With binary measure (1 or 0 to indicate significant and non-significant genes), one-tailed Fisher's exact test for over-representation of each KOG class among significant genes will be performed.
