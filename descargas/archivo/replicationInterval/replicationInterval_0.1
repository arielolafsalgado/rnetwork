Description: A common problem faced by journal reviewers and authors is the
    question of whether the results of a replication study are consistent with
    the original published study. One solution to this problem is to examine
    the effect size from the published study and generate the range of effect
    sizes that could reasonably be obtained (due to random sampling) in a
    replication attempt (i.e., calculate a replication interval). If a
    replication effect size falls outside the replication interval then that
    value could not have occurred to due the effects of sampling error alone.
    Alternatively, if a replication effect size falls within the replication
    interval then the replication results could have reasonably occurred due to
    the effects of sampling error alone. This package has functions that
    calculate the replication interval for two different types of effect sizes
    (i.e., correlation, Cohen's d).
