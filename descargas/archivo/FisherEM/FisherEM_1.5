Description: FisherEM is an efficient algorithm for 
        the unsupervised classification of high-dimensional data. FisherEM 
	models and clusters the data in a discriminative and low-dimensional
	latent subspace. It also provides a low-dimensional representation 
	of the clustered data. A sparse version of Fisher-EM algorithm is also provided.
