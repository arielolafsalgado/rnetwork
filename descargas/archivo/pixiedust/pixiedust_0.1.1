Title: Tables so Beautifully Fine-Tuned You Will Believe It's Magic
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: person("Benjamin", "Nutter", email = "nutter@battelle.org", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The introduction of the broom package has made converting model objects into data 
  frames as simple as a single function.  While the broom package focuses on providing tidy
  data frames that can be used in advanced analysis, it deliberately stops short of providing 
  functionality for reporting models in publication-ready tables.  pixiedust provides this 
  functionality with a programming interface intended to be similar to ggplot2's system of 
  layers with fine tuned control over each cell of the table.  Options for output include 
  printing to the console and to the common markdown formats (markdown, HTML, and LaTeX). 
  With a little pixiedust (and happy thoughts) tables can really fly.
