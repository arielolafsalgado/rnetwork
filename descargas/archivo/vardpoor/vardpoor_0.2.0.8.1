Description: Generation of domain variables, linearisation of several nonlinear population statistics (the ratio of two totals, weighted income percentile, at-risk-of-poverty rate, at-risk-of-poverty threshold, Gini coefficient, gender pay gap, median income below at-risk-of-poverty gap, income quintile share ratio, relative median at-risk-of-poverty gap), computation of regression residuals in case of weight calibration, Variance Estimation of sample surveys by the ultimate cluster method (Hansen, Hurwitz and Madow, 1953). Several other precision measures are derived - standard error, the coefficient of variation, the margin of error, confidence interval, design effect.
