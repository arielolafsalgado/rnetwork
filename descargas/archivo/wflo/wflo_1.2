Description: Provides a convenient data set, a set of helper functions and a benchmark function for
    economically (profit) driven wind farm layout optimization. This enables researchers in the field of the
	NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard) problem of wind farm layout optimization to focus on their optimization methodology contribution and also provides a realistic benchmark setting for comparability among contributions.
