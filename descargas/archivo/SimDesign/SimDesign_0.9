Description: Provides tools to help safely and efficiently organize Monte Carlo simulations in R.
    The package controls the structure and back-end of Monte Carlo simulations
    by utilizing a general generate-analyse-summarise strategy. The functions provided control
    common simulation issues such as re-simulating non-convergent results, support parallel
    back-end and MPI distributed computations, save and restore temporary files,
    aggregate results across independent nodes, and provide native support for debugging.
