Description: Provides tools to help organize Monte Carlo simulations in R. The
    tools provided control the structure and back-end of the Monte Carlo simulations
    by utilizing a generate-analyse-summarise strategy. The functions control common
    simulation issues such as re-simulating non-convergent results, support parallel
    back-end computations, save and restore temporary files, aggregate results
    across independent nodes, and provide native support for debugging.
