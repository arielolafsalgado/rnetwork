Title: Evolutionary Trait Divergence Between Sister Species and Other
        Paired Lineages

Author: Sean A. S. Anderson and Jason T. Weir
Description: Compares alternative models of continuous trait differentiation in sister species and other paired lineages. Alternative models include approximations of divergent selection, drift, and stabilizing selection, plus a variety of extensions to facilitate the testing of process-to-pattern hypotheses. Alternative processes are expected to leave unique signatures in the distribution of trait differentiation in datasets comprised of many species pairs. Users supply species pair trait data and divergence times. The fit of alternative models is compared in a likelihood framework.
