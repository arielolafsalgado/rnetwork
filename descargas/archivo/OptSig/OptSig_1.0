Description: Calculates the optimal level of significance based on a decision-theoretic approach. 
	The optimal level is chosen so that the expected loss from hypothesis testing is minimized. 
	A range of statistical tests are covered, including the test for the population mean, population proportion, and a linear restriction in a multiple regression model. 
        The details are covered in Kim, Jae H. and Choi, In, Choosing the Level of Significance: A Decision-Theoretic Approach (December 18, 2017), available at SSRN: <https://ssrn.com/abstract=2652773> or <doi:10.2139/ssrn.2652773>.
