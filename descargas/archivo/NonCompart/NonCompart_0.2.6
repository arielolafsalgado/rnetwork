Title: Noncompartmental Analysis for Pharmacokinetic Data
Description: Conduct a noncompartmental analysis as closely as possible to the most widely used commercial software for pharmacokinetic analysis, i.e. 'Phoenix(R) WinNonlin(R)' <https://www.certara.com/software/pkpd-modeling-and-simulation/phoenix-winnonlin/>.
             Some features include:
             1) Use CDISC SDTM PP domain terms.
             2) Automatic slope selection with the same criterion of WinNonlin(R)
             3) Support both 'linear-up linear-down' and 'linear-up log-down' method
             4) Calculate partial(interval) AUC with 'linear' or 'log' interpolation method
             For more details on noncompartmental analysis, see the reference: Gabrielsson J, Weiner D. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data Analysis - Concepts and Applications. 5th ed. 2016. (ISBN:9198299107)
