Description: Randomization tests for the statistical comparison of \emph{i} = two or more individual-based, sample-based or coverage-based rarefaction curves. The ecological null hypothesis is that the \emph{i} samples were all drawn randomly from a single assemblage, with (necessarily) a single underlying species abundance distribution. The biogeographic null hypothesis is that the \emph{i} samples were all drawn from different assemblages that, nonetheless, share similar species richness and species abundance distributions
