Title: Methods for Adaptive Shrinkage, using Empirical Bayes
Description: The R package 'ashr' implements an Empirical Bayes
    approach for large-scale hypothesis testing and false discovery
    rate (FDR) estimation based on the methods proposed in
    M. Stephens, 2016, "False discovery rates: a new deal",
    <DOI:10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041>. These methods can be applied
    whenever two sets of summary statistics---estimated effects and
    standard errors---are available, just as 'qvalue' can be applied
    to previously computed p-values. Two main interfaces are
    provided: ash(), which is more user-friendly; and ash.workhorse(),
    which has more options and is geared toward advanced users. The
    ash() and ash.workhorse() also provides a flexible modeling
    interface that can accomodate a variety of likelihoods (e.g.,
    normal, Poisson) and mixture priors (e.g., uniform, normal).
