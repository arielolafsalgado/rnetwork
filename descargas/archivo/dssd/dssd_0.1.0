Title: Distance Sampling Survey Design
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Laura Marshall <lhm@st-andrews.ac.uk>
Maintainer: Laura Marshall <lhm@st-andrews.ac.uk>
Description: Creates survey designs for distance sampling surveys. These
    designs can be assessed for various effort and coverage statistics.
    Once the user is satisfied with the design characteristics they can 
    generate a set of transects to use in their distance sampling survey.
    Many of the designs implemented in this R package were first made 
    available in our 'Distance' for Windows software and are detailed in 
    Chapter 7 of Advanced Distance Sampling, Buckland et. al. (2008, 
    ISBN-13: 978-0199225873). Find out more about estimating animal/plant 
    abundance with distance sampling at <http://distancesampling.org/>.
