Description: Automatic generation of exams based on exercises in Markdown or LaTeX format,
	possibly including R code for dynamic generation of exercise elements.
	Exercise types include single- and multiple-choice questions, arithmetic problems,
	string questions, and combinations thereof (cloze). Output formats include
	PDF, HTML, Moodle XML, QTI 1.2 (for OLAT/OpenOLAT), QTI 2.1, Blackboard, ARSnova, and TCExam.
	In addition to fully customizable PDF exams, a standardized PDF format is provided that can be
	printed, scanned, and automatically evaluated.
