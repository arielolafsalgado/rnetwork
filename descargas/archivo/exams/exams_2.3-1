Description: Automatic generation of exams based on exercises in Markdown or LaTeX format,
	possibly including R code for dynamic generation of exercise elements.
	Exercise types include single-choice and multiple-choice questions, arithmetic problems,
	string questions, and combinations thereof (cloze). Output formats include standalone
	files (PDF, HTML, Docx, ODT, ...), Moodle XML, QTI 1.2 (for OLAT/OpenOLAT), QTI 2.1,
	Blackboard, ARSnova, and TCExam. In addition to fully customizable PDF exams, a
	standardized PDF format (NOPS) is provided that can be printed, scanned, and automatically evaluated.
