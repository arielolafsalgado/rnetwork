Description: statar makes it easier to work with tabular datasets. The package
    includes a set of functions to clean and summarize variables, to join
    datasets using an SQL-syntax, to manipulate datasets with a panel structure
    (elapsed dates, lead/lag, rolling functions, fill in missing values based
    on previous dates, add rows for missing dates). The package also includes
    functions to emulate Stata and Julia string and expression interpolation.
    statar is based on the data.table package and is inspired by Stata.
