Title: A Package for Graphical Modelling in R

Description: The 'gRbase' package provides graphical modelling features
    used by e.g. the packages 'gRain', 'gRim' and 'gRc'.
    'gRbase' contains data sets relevant for use in connection with
    graphical models (in particular all data sets used in the book Graphical
    Models with R (2012)). 
        'gRbase' implements graph algorithms including
    (i) maximum cardinality search (for marked and unmarked graphs).
    (ii) moralize.
    (iii) triangulate.
    (iv) junction tree.
    'gRbase' facilitates array operations,
    'gRbase' implements functions for testing for conditional independence.
    'gRbase' illustrates how hierarchical log-linear models may be
    implemented and describes concept of graphical meta
    data. These features, however, are not maintained anymore and
    remains in 'gRbase' only because there exists a paper describing
    these facilities: A Common Platform for Graphical Models in R:
    The 'gRbase' Package, Journal of Statistical Software, Vol 14,
    No 17, 2005.
    NOTICE  'gRbase' requires that the packages graph,
    'Rgraphviz' and 'RBGL' are installed from 'bioconductor'; for
    installation instructions please refer to the web page given below.
