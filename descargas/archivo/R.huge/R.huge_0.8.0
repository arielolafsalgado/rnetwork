Description: THIS PACKAGE HAS BEEN DEPRECATED. Do not start building new projects based on it. Cross-platform alternatives are the following packages: bigmemory (CRAN), ff (CRAN), BufferedMatrix (Bioconductor).  The main usage of it was inside the aroma.affymetrix package. (The package currently provides a class representing a matrix where the actual data is stored in a binary format on the local file system.  This way the size limit of the data is set by the file system and not the memory.)
