Description: Operations on triangular meshes based on VCGLIB. This package
    integrates nicely with the R-package "rgl" to render the meshes processed
    by Rvcg. The Visualization and Computer Graphics Library (VCG for short) is
    an open source portable C++ templated library for manipulation, processing
    and displaying with OpenGL of triangle and tetrahedral meshes. The library,
    composed by more than 100k lines of code, is released under the GPL
    license, and it is the base of most of the software tools of the Visual
    Computing Lab of the Italian National Research Council Institute ISTI
    (http://vcg.isti.cnr.it), like metro and MeshLab.
    The vcglib source is pulled from
    trunk (svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/vcg/code/trunk/vcglib) and patched to work
    with options determined by the configure script as well as
    to work with the header files included by RcppEigen.
