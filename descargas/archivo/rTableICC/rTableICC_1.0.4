Description: Contains functions for random generation of R x C and 2 x 2 x K contingency tables. In addition to the generation of contingency tables over predetermined intraclass-correlated clusters, it is possible to generate contingency tables without intraclass correlations under product multinomial, multinomial, and Poisson sampling plans. It also consists of a function for generation of random data from a given discrete probability distribution function.
