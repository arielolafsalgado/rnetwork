Description: Provides a very interesting solution for
    handling segmentation variables in complex statistical methodology. It
    contains en extended version of the "Pathmox" algorithm (Lamberti, Sanchez
    and Aluja,(2016)<doi:10.1002/asmb.2168>) in the context of
    Partial Least Squares Path Modeling including the F-block
    test (to detect the responsible latent endogenous equations of the
    difference), the F-coefficient (to detect the path coefficients responsible
    of the difference) and the "invariance" test (to realize a comparison
    between the sub-models' latent variables). Furthermore, the package
    contains a generalized version of the "Pathmox" algorithm to approach
    different methodologies: linear regression and least absolute regression
    models.
