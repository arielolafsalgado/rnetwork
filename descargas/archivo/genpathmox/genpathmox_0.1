Package: genpathmox
Title: Generalized PATHMOX Algorithm for PLS-PM, LS and LAD Regression
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "Giuseppe Lamberti <giuseppelamb@hotmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: genpathmox provides a very interesting solution for handling
    segmentation variables in complex statistical methodology. It contains en
    extended version of the PATHMOX algorithm in the context of partial least
    square path modeling (Sanchez, 2009) including the F-block test (to detect
    the responsible latent endogenous equations of the difference), the
    F-coefficient (to detect the path coefficients responsible of the
    difference) and the invariance test (to realize a comparison between the
    sub-models' latent variables). Furthermore, the package contains a
    generalized version of the PATHMOX algorithm to approach different
    methodologies: linear regression and least absolute regression models.
