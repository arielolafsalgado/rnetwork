Description: Helps enable adaptive management by codifying knowledge in the
    form of models generated from numerous analyses and data sets. Facilitates
    this process by storing all models and data sets in a single object that can
    be updated and saved, thus tracking changes in knowledge through time. A shiny
    application called AM Model Manager (modelMgr()) enables the use of these
    functions via a GUI.
