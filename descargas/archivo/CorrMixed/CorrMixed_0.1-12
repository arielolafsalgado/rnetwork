Description: In clinical practice and research settings in medicine and the behavioral sciences, it is often of interest to quantify the correlation of a continuous endpoint that was repeatedly measured (e.g., test-retest correlations, ICC, etc.). This package allows for estimating these correlations based on mixed-effects models. Part of this software has been developed using funding provided from the European Union's 7th Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under Grant Agreement no 602552.
