Description: The R package 'decompr' implements two export decomposition
    algorithms. Firstly, the Wang-Wei-Zhu (Wang, Wei, and Zhu 2013) algorithm
    splits bilateral gross exports into 16 value added components. Secondly,
    the Source decomposition algorithm derives the value added origin of
    exports by country and industry, which is also based on Wang, Wei, and Zhu
    (2013).
