Description: Two Global Value Chains decompositions are implemented. Firstly,
    the Wang-Wei-Zhu (Wang, Wei, and Zhu 2013) algorithm splits bilateral gross
    exports into 16 value added components. Secondly, the Leontief decomposition
    (default) derives the value added origin of exports by country and
    industry, which is also based on Wang, Wei, and Zhu (2013).
