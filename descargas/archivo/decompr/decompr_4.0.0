Title: Global-Value-Chain Decomposition
Description: Two global-value-chain decompositions are implemented.
    Firstly, the Wang-Wei-Zhu (Wang, Wei, and Zhu, 2013) algorithm splits bilateral gross
    exports into 16 value-added components. Secondly, the Leontief decomposition
    (default) derives the value added origin of exports by country and
    industry, which is also based on Wang, Wei, and Zhu
    (Wang, Z., S.-J. Wei, and K. Zhu. 2013. "Quantifying International Production Sharing at the Bilateral and Sector Levels.").
