 as described in J. Ramsay G. and Hooker (2017,ISBN 978-1-4939-7188-6) 
 Dynamic Data Analysis, New York: Springer.  
 The package includes data sets and script files for analyzing many of the 
 examples in this book. A Vignette provides detailed examples for two models.
 'Matlab' versions of the code and sample analyses are available by ftp from
 <http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/Data2LD/>.  There you find 
 a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses, as well 
 as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional 
 information.
