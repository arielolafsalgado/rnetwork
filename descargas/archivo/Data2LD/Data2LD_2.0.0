Author: James Ramsay [aut, cre]
Maintainer: James Ramsay <James.Ramsay@mcgill.ca>
Depends: R (>= 2.10.0), fda, splines, Matrix, graphics, deSolve
Description: Provides methods for using differential equations as modelling  
 objects as described in J. Ramsay G. and Hooker (2017,ISBN 978-1-4939-7188-6) 
 Dynamic Data Analysis, New York: Springer. Data sets and script files for 
 analyzing many of the examples in this book are included. This version 
 corrects bugs and adds a new demo, CruiseControl. 'Matlab' versions of the 
 code and sample analyses are available by ftp from 
 <http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/Data2LD/>.  There you find 
 a set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses, as well 
 as two .txt files giving instructions for installation and some additional
