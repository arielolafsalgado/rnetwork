Description: Algorithms and utility functions for indoor positioning using fingerprinting techniques. 
    These functions are designed for manipulation of RSSI data sets, estimation of positions,
    comparison of the performance of different models, and graphical visualization
    of data. Machine learning algorithms and methods such as k-nearest neighbors or
    probabilistic fingerprinting are implemented in this package to perform analysis
    and estimations over RSSI data sets.
