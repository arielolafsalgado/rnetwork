Description: 
        Functionality required to efficiently use R with IBM(R) Db2(R) 
        Warehouse offerings (formerly IBM dashDB(R)) and IBM Db2 for z/OS(R) in 
        conjunction with IBM Db2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS. 
        Many basic and complex R operations are pushed down into the database, 
        which removes the main memory boundary of R and allows to make full 
        use of parallel processing in the underlying database.
