Description: Functionality required to efficiently use R with
        IBM DB2(C) for Linux, Unix and Windows as well as IBM dashDB(C).
        Many basic and complex R operations are pushed down into the database, which removes
        the main memory boundary of R and allows to make full use of parallel processing in
        the underlying database.
