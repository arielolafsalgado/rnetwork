Description: Functionality required to efficiently use R with
        IBM DB2(C) for Linux, Unix and Windows, IBM dashDB(C) as well as 
        DB2 for z/OS (C) in conjunction with IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator (C).
        Many basic and complex R operations are pushed down into the database, 
        which removes the main memory boundary of R and allows to make full 
        use of parallel processing in the underlying database.
