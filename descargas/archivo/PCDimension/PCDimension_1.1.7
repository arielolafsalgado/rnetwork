Title: Finding the Number of Significant Principal Components
Author: Kevin R. Coombes, Min Wang
Maintainer: Kevin R. Coombes <krc@silicovore.com>
Description: Implements methods to automate the Auer-Gervini graphical
  Bayesian approach for determining the number of significant
  principal components. Automation uses clustering, change points, or
  simple statistical models to distinguish "long" from "short" steps
  in a graph showing the posterior number of components as a function
  of a prior parameter.
