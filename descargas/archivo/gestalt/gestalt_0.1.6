Title: Tools for Making and Combining Functions
Version: 0.1.6
Authors@R: person("Eugene", "Ha", , "eha@posteo.de", c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides a suite of function-building tools centered around a
  (forward) composition operator, %>>>%, which extends the semantics of the
  'magrittr' %>% operator and supports 'tidyverse' quasiquotation. It enables
  you to construct composite functions that can be inspected and transformed as
  list-like objects. In conjunction with %>>>%, a compact function constructor,
  fn(), and a function that performs partial application, partial(), are also
  provided. Both support quasiquotation.
