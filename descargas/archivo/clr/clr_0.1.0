Description: A new methodology for linear regression with both curve response 
    and curve regressors, which is described in Cho, Goude, Brossat and Yao 
    (2013) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2012.722900> and (2015) 
    <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-18732-7_3>. The key idea behind this methodology is 
    dimension reduction based on a singular value decomposition in a Hilbert 
    space, which reduces the curve regression problem to several scalar linear 
    regression problems.
