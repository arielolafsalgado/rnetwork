Description: Used for processing data obtained from behaviour experiments studying
    acoustic startle response, a reflex to a loud sound, modulated by several 
    brain regions. The input data is generated with PASTA (Platform for Acoustic 
    STArtle), a DIY device made from a kitchen scale that measures the twitch of 
    an animal standing on the device and records it as time-series data. The 
    function of this package is to import all data, process it in accordance 
    with default or custom metadata describing the experiment protocol, calculate 
    measurements and visualize the results. The PASTA solution and this package
    are described in Virag et al. (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.04.10.035766>.
