Description: Purpose of this package is it to plan, monitor and evaluate oncological phase II studies. In general this kind of studies are single-arm trials with planned interim analysis and binary endpoint. To meet the resulting requirements, the package provides functions to calculate and evaluate "Simon's two-stage designs" and so called "subset designs". If you are unfamiliar with this package a good starting point is to take a closer look at the functions "getSolutions" and "getSolutionsSub1".
