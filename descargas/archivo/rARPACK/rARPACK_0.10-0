Description: Previously an R wrapper of the 'ARPACK' library
    <http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/>, and from version 0.8-0 an R
    interface to the 'Spectra' library <http://yixuan.cos.name/spectra/>
    to solve large scale eigenvalue/vector problems.
    It is typically used to compute a few
    eigenvalues/vectors of an n by n matrix, e.g., the k largest eigenvalues,
    which is usually more efficient than eigen() if k << n. This package
    provides the 'eigs()' function which does the similar job as in 'Matlab',
    'Octave', 'Python SciPy' and 'Julia'. It also provides the 'svds()' function
    to calculate the largest k singular values and corresponding
    singular vectors of a real matrix. Matrices can be given in either dense
    or sparse form.
