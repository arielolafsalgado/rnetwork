Description: rARPACK is an R wrapper of the ARPACK library
    (http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/) to solve large scale
    eigenvalue/vector problems. It is typically used to compute a few
    eigenvalues/vectors of an n by n matrix, e.g., the k largest eigenvalues,
    which is usually more efficient than eigen() if k << n. This package
    provides the eigs() function which does the similar job as in Matlab,
    Octave, Python SciPy and Julia. It also provides the svds() function
    to calculate the largest k singular values and corresponding
    singular vectors of a real matrix. Matrices can be given in either dense
    or sparse form.
