Description: Data class for increased interoperability working with spatial-
    temporal data together with corresponding functions and methods (conversions,
    basic calculations and basic data manipulation). The class distinguishes
    between spatial, temporal and other dimensions to facilitate the development
    and interoperability of tools build for it. Additional features are name-based
    addressing of data and internal consistency checks (e.g. checking for the right
    data order in calculations).
