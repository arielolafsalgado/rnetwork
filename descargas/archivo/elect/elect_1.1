Title: Estimation of Life Expectancies Using Multi-State Models
Version: 1.1
Author: Ardo van den Hout and Mei Sum Chan
Maintainer: Ardo van den Hout <Ardo.vandenHout@ucl.ac.uk>
Description: Functions to compute state-specific and marginal life expectancies. The computation is based on a fitted continuous-time multi-state model that includes an absorbing death state; see Van den Hout (2017, ISBN:9781466568402). The fitted multi-state model model should be estimated using the 'msm' package using age as the time-scale.
