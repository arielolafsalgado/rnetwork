Description: A collection of functions to make building customized ready-to-export tables for publication purposes easier or expedite summarization of a large dataset for review. Includes methods for automatically building a table from data or building the table row-by-row. Key functions include build_row() & build_table() for summarizing columns of data overall or by stratum with appropriate testing and build_event_row() & build_event_table() for creating tables that summarize time-to-event model (Cox PH) parameters, supporting both univariate and multivariate methods.
