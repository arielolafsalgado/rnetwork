Description: This package provides functions for the spatial interpolation 
             of genetic distances between samples. The interpolation is 
             based on a modified kriging method that accepts a genetic 
             distance matrix and generates a map of probability of lineage 
             presence. This package also offers tools to generate a map of 
             potential contact zones between groups with user-defined 
             thresholds in the tree to account for old and recent 
             divergence. Additionally, it has functions for IDW 
             interpolation using genetic data and midpoints.
