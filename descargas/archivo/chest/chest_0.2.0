Title: Change-in-Estimate Approach to Assess Confounding Effects
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: person("Zhiqiang", "Wang", email = "zhiqiang.wang@menzies.edu.au", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The 'chest' package applies the change-in-effect estimate method 
    for assessing confounding effects in medical and epidemiological research.
    It starts with a crude model including only the outcome and exposure variables. 
    At each of the subsequent steps, one variable which creates the largest change 
    among the remaining variables is selected. This process is repeated until all 
    variables have been entered into the model (Wang Z (2007) <doi:10.1177/1536867X0700700203>). 
    Currently, the 'chest' package has functions for linear regression, logistic 
    regression, Cox proportional hazards model and conditional logistic regression.
