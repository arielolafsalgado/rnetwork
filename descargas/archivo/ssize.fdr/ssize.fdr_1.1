Description: This package contains a set of functions that calculates
        appropriate sample sizes for one-sample t-tests, two-sample
        t-tests, and F-tests for microarray experiments based on
        desired power while controlling for false discovery rates. For
        all tests, the standard deviations (variances) among genes can
        be assumed fixed or random.  This is also true for effect sizes
        among genes in one-sample and two sample experiments. Functions
        also output a chart of power versus sample size, a table of
        power at different sample sizes, and a table of critical test
        values at different sample sizes.
