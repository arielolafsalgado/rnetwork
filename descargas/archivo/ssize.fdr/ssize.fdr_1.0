Description: This package contains a set of functions that calculates 
 appropriate sample sizes for one-sample t-tests, two-sample t-tests, 
 and F-tests for microarray experiments based on desired power while 
 controlling for false discovery rates. For all tests, the standard
 deviations (variances) among genes can be assumed fixed or random. 
 This is also true for effect sizes among genes in one-sample experiments
 and differences in mean treatment expressions for two-sample experiments.
 Functions also output a chart of power versus sample size, a table of
 power at different sample sizes, and a table of critical test values
 at different sample sizes.
