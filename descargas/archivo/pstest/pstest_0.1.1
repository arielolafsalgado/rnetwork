Description: The propensity score is one of the most widely used tools in studying the causal effect
    of a treatment, intervention, or policy. Given that the propensity score is usually unknown,
    it has to be estimated, implying that the reliability of many treatment effect estimators depends
    on the correct specification of the (parametric) propensity score. This package provides
    data-driven nonparametric diagnostic tools for detecting propensity score misspecification.
