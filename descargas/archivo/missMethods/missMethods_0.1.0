Description: Supply functions for the creation and handling of missing data 
    as well as tools to evaluate missing data methods. Nearly all possibilities
    of generating missing data discussed by Santos et. al (2019) 
    <doi:10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2891360> and some additional are implemented. 
    Functions are supplied to compare parameter estimates and imputed values to 
    true values to evaluate missing data methods. Evaluations of these types 
    are done, for example, by Cetin-Berber et al. (2019) 
    <doi:10.1177/0013164418805532>  and Kim et al. (2005) 
    <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bth499>.
