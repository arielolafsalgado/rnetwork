Description: A tool for locating, mapping, and gathering meteorological data from various US surface networks: COOP, USCRN, USRCRN, AL-USRCRN, ASOS, AWOS, SNOTEL, SNOTEL-LITE, SCAN, SNOW, and NEON. The functions within this package allow the user to locate stations that are near a user specified latitude and longitude (or NEON site). Future updates to the package will allow the user to obtain datasets from these networks.
