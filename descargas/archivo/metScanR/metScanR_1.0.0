Description: A tool for locating, mapping, and gathering environmental data and metadata, worldwide.  Users can search for and filter metadata from ~ 107,000 environmental monitoring stations among 219 countries/territories and 18 networks/platforms via elevation, location, active dates, elements measured (e.g., temperature, precipitation), country, network, and/or known identifier. Future updates to the package will allow the user to obtain datasets from stations within the database.
