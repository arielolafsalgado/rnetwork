Description: Simulation tools for planning Vitamin D studies including
             approximation of power. Individual vitamin D status 
             profiles are simulated, modelling population heterogeneity. 
             Individuals experience random exposures to infectious 		agents. Development of infection considers a heterogeneous treatment effect. This is incorporated into the power approximation.
