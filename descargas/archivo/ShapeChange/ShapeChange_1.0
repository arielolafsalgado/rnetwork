Description: In a scatterplot where the response variable is Gaussian, Poisson or binomial, we consider the case in which the mean function is smooth with a change-point, which is a mode, an inflection point or a jump point. The main routine estimates the mean curve and the change-point as well using shape-restricted B-splines. An optional subroutine delivering a bootstrapping confidence interval for the change-point is incorporated in the main routine.
