Title: Get, Download, and Read City Bike Data from Norway
Description: Functions to get, download, and read open data from each City Bike
    website, and each City Bike API, in Norway that is made available under the
    NLOD 2.0 <https://data.norge.no/nlod/en/2.0>. These functions speed up the
    process of reading city bike data directly to R, and to download the data 
    to disk, so that the user can focus on data analysis. The data is 
    retrieved from the "developer" or "open data" pages of 
    Oslo City Bike <https://developer.oslobysykkel.no/>, 
    Oslo Winter Bike <https://oslovintersykkel.no/en/open-data>, 
    Bergen City Bike <https://bergenbysykkel.no/en/open-data>, and
    Trondheim City Bike <https://trondheimbysykkel.no/en/open-data>.
