Description: phaseR is an R package for the qualitative analysis of one and
   two dimensional autonomous ODE systems, using phase plane methods. Programs
   are available to identify and classify equilibrium points, plot the
   direction field, and plot trajectories for multiple initial conditions. In
   the one dimensional case, a program is also available to plot the phase
   portrait. Whilst in the two dimensional case, additionally a program is
   available to plot nullclines. Many example systems are provided for the
   user.
