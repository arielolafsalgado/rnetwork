Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: person("Travis", "Riddle", email = "travis.riddle@nih.gov", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A minimal wrapper around the NIH's 'iCite' API (<https://icite.od.nih.gov/api>). 
  Given a vector of pubmed IDs, this package returns a dataframe of the information yielded by
  the 'iCite' API. The primary metrics yielded by 'iCite' are measurements of a paper's 
  scientific influence and translational potential, but the API also returns other meta-data 
  from the paper, including author names, publication journal, publication year, paper title, 
  doi, and a number of other citation metrics.
