Description: Computes the areas under the precision-recall (PR) and ROC curve for weighted (e.g., soft-labeled) and unweighted data. In contrast to other implementations, the interpolation between points of the PR curve is done by a non-linear piecewise function. In addition to the areas under the curves, the curves themselves can also be computed and plotted by a specific S3-method.
