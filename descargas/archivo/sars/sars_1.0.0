        Multimodel Inference
Version: 1.0.0

                  role = c("aut", "cre")),

Description: Implements the basic elements of the multi-model 
    inference paradigm for up to twenty species-area relationship models (SAR), using simple 
    R list-objects and functions, as in Triantis et al. 2012 <DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02652.x>.
    The package is scalable and users can easily create their own model and data objects. Additional 
    SAR related functions are provided.
