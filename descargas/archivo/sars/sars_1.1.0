Title: Fit and Compare Species-Area Relationship Models Using
        Multimodel Inference
Version: 1.1.0
Authors@R: c(person("Thomas J.", "Matthews", email = "txm676@gmail.com",
                  role = c("aut", "cre")),

                  role = c("aut")))
Description: Implements the basic elements of the multi-model
    inference paradigm for up to twenty species-area relationship models (SAR), using simple
    R list-objects and functions, as in Triantis et al. 2012 <DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02652.x>.
    The package is scalable and users can easily create their own model and data objects. Additional
    SAR related functions are provided.
