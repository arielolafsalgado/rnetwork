Description: Consider the linear mixed model with normal random effects. A typical method to solve Henderson's Mixed Model Equations (HMME) is recursive estimation of the fixed effects and random effects. We provide a fast, stable, and scalable solver to the HMME without computing matrix inverse. See Kim (2017) <arXiv:1710.09663> for more details.
