Description: Simplex density, distribution, quantile functions as well as random variable
   	generation of the simplex distribution are given. Regression analysis of proportional data
   	using various kinds of simplex models is available. In addition, GEE method can be applied 
	to longitudinal data to model the correlation. Residual analysis is also involved. Some 
	subroutines are written in C with GNU Scientific Library (GSL) so as to facilitate the 
	computation.
