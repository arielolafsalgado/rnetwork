Description: It is vital to assess the heterogeneity of treatment effects
    (HTE) when making health care decisions for an individual patient or a group
    of patients. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to evaluate HTE based
    on information collected from clinical studies that are often designed and
    conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment for the overall population.
    The Bayesian framework offers a principled and flexible approach to estimate
    and compare treatment effects across subgroups of patients defined by their
    characteristics. This package allows users to explore a wide range of Bayesian
    HTE analysis models, and produce posterior inferences about HTE.
