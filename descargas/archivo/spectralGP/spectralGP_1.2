Title: Approximate Gaussian processes using the Fourier basis
Description: Routines for creating, manipulating, and performing 
 Bayesian inference about Gaussian processes in 
 one and two dimensions using the Fourier basis approximation: 
 simulation and plotting of processes, calculation of 
 coefficient variances, calculation of process density, 
 coefficient proposals (for use in MCMC).  It uses R environments to
 store GP objects as references/pointers.
