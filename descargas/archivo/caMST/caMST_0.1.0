Description: Provides functions to more easily analyze computerized adaptive tests. Currently, functions for computerized 
  adaptive tests (CAT), computer adaptive multistage tests (CMT), and mixed computer adaptive multistage tests (McaMST) 
  utilizing CAT item-level adaptation for the initial stage and traditional MST module-level adaptation for the subsequent 
  stages have been created, and a variation of Hybrid computer adaptive MST is planned as well. For an in-depth look at 
  CAT and MST, see Weiss & Kingsbury (1984) <doi:10.1111/j.1745-3984.1984.tb01040.x> and Luecht & Nungester 
  (2000) <doi:10.1007/0-306-47531-6_6> respectively.
