Description: Bootstrap Subsamplings of sparse Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (sPLS-DA) for Classification and Signature Identification. The method is applicable to any classification problem with more than 2 classes. It relies on bootstrap subsamplings of sPLS-DA and provides tools to select the most stable variables (defined as the ones consistently selected over the bootstrap subsamplings) and to predict the class of test samples.
