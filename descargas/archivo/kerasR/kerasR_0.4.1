Description: Provides a consistent interface to the 'Keras' Deep Learning Library
  directly from within R. 'Keras' (see <https://keras.io/> for more information)
  provides specifications for describing dense neural networks, convolution
  neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) running on top
  of either 'TensorFlow' (<https://www.tensorflow.org/>)  or 'Theano'
  (<http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/>). Type conversions between
  Python and R are automatically handled correctly, even when the default
  choices would otherwise lead to errors. Includes complete R documentation
  and many working examples.
