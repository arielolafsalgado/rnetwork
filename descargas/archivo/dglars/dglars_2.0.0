Description: Differential geometric least angle regression method for fitting 
	sparse generalized linear models. In this version of the package, the user can fit
	models specifying Gaussian, Poisson, Binomial, Gamma and Inverse Gaussian family. 
	Furthermore, several link functions can be used to model the relationship between the 
	conditional expected value of the response variable and the linear predictor. The 
	solution curve can be computed using an efficient predictor-corrector or a cyclic 
	coordinate descent algorithm, as described in the paper linked to via the URL below.
