Description: Estimation of the generalized beta distribution of the second 
    kind (GB2) and related models using grouped data in form of income shares. 
    The GB2 family is a general class of distributions that provides an accurate 
    fit to income data. 'GB2group' includes functions to estimate the GB2, the 
    Singh-Maddala, the Dagum, the Beta 2, the Lognormal and the Fisk distributions. 
    'GB2group' deploys two different econometric strategies to estimate these 
    parametric distributions, non-linear least squares (NLS) and the generalised 
    method of moments (GMM). Asymptotic standard errors are reported for the 
    GMM estimates. Standard errors of the NLS estimates are obtained by Monte 
    Carlo simulation. See Jorda et al. (2018) <arXiv:1808.09831> for a detailed 
    description of the estimation procedure.
