Description: Exact and approximation algorithms for variable-subset
  selection in ordinary linear regression models.  Either compute all
  submodels with the lowest residual sum of squares, or determine the
  single-best submodel according to a pre-determined statistical
  criterion.  Hofmann, Gatu, Kontoghiorghes, Colubi, Zeileis (2018,
  submitted).
