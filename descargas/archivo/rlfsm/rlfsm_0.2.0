Description: Contains functions for simulating linear fractional stable motions, according to techniques developed by Stoev and Taqqu (2004) <doi:10.1142/S0218348X04002379>, as well as functions for computing important statistics used with these processes introduced by Mazur, Otryakhin and Podolskij (2018) <arXiv:1802.06373>, and also different quantities related to those statistics.
