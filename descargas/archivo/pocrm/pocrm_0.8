Description: This package provides functions to implement and simulate the partial order continual reassessment method (PO-CRM) for use in Phase I trials of combinations of agents. It also provides a function for generating a set of initial guesses (skeleton) for the toxicity probabilities at each combination that correspond to the set of possible orderings of the toxicity probabilities specified by the user.
