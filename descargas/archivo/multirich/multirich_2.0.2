Description: Functions to calculate Unique Trait Combinations (UTC) and
    scaled Unique Trait Combinations (sUTC) as measures of multivariate
    richness. The package can also calculate beta-diversity for trait richness and
    can partition this into nestedness-related and turnover components. The
    code will also calculate several measures of overlap.
