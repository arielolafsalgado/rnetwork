Description: Provides general linear model facilities (single y-variable, multiple x-variables with arbitrary mixture of continuous and categorical and arbitrary interactions) for cross-species data. The theory is in A. Grafen (1989, Proc. R. Soc. B 326, 119-157) and aims to cope with both recognised phylogeny (closely related species tend to be similar) and unrecognised phylogeny (a polytomy usually indicates ignorance about the true  sequence of binary splits). Version 1.0.1 is a technical update required by changes to R: there is no change to the package operations.
