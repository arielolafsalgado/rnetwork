Description: Many statistical models and analyses in R are implemented through formula objects. The formulaic package creates a unified approach for programmatically and dynamically generating formula objects. Users may specify the outcome and inputs of a model directly, search for variables to include based upon naming patterns, incorporate interactions, and identify variables to exclude. A wide range of quality checks are implemented to identify issues such as misspecified variables, duplication, a lack of contrast in the inputs, and a large number of levels in categorical data.  Variables that do not meet these quality checks can be automatically excluded from the model.  These issues are documented and reported in a manner that provides greater accountability and useful information to guide an investigation of the data.
