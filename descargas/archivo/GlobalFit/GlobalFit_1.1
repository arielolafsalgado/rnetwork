Title: Bi-Level Optimization of Metabolic Network Models
Version: 1.1
Date: 2016-03-30
Author: Daniel Hartleb
Maintainer: Daniel Hartleb <daniel.hartleb@hhu.de>
Description: Initial metabolic networks often inaccurately predict in-silico growth or non-growth if compared to in-vivo data. This package refines metabolic network models by making networks changes (i.e., removing, adding, changing reversibility of reactions; adding and removing biomass metabolites) and simultaneously matching sets of experimental growth and non-growth data (e.g., KO-mutants, mutants grown under different media conditions,...)
