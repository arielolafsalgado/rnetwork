Description: Provides movies to help students to understand statistical 
  concepts.  The 'rpanel' package  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=rpanel> 
  is used to create interactive plots that move to illustrate key statistical 
  ideas and methods.  There are movies to: visualise probability distributions
  (including user-supplied ones); illustrate sampling distributions of the
  sample mean (central limit theorem), the sample maximum (extremal types 
  theorem) and (the Fisher transformation of the) Pearson product moment 
  correlation coefficient; examine the influence of an individual observation 
  in simple linear regression; illustrate key concepts in statistical 
  hypothesis testing. Also provided are dpqr functions for the distribution of 
  the Fisher transformation of the correlation coefficient under sampling from 
  a bivariate normal distribution.
