Description: This is an R package accompanying the paper "Parameterizing cell-to-cell regulatory heterogeneities via stochastic transcriptional profiles" by Sameer S Bajikar, Christiane Fuchs, Andreas Roller, Fabian J Theis and Kevin A Janes (PNAS 2014, 111(5), E626-635). In this paper, we measure expression profiles from small heterogeneous populations of cells, where each cell is assumed to be from a mixture of lognormal distributions. We perform maximum likelihood estimation in order to infer the mixture ratio and the parameters of these lognormal distributions from the cumulated expression measurements.
