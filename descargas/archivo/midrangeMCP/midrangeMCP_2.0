Description: Apply tests of multiple comparisons based
    on studentized midrange and range distributions. 
    The tests are: Tukey Midrange (TM test),
    Student-Newman-Keuls Midrange (SNKM test), 
    Means Grouping Midrange (MGM test) and 
    Means Grouping Range (MGR test). The articles of these 
    tests are in the submission phase, and we will soon update the references.
