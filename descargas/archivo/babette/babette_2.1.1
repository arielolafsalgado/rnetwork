Description: 'BEAST2' (<http://www.beast2.org>) is a widely used
    Bayesian phylogenetic tool, that uses DNA/RNA/protein data
    and many model priors to create a posterior of jointly estimated 
    phylogenies and parameters.
    'BEAST2' is commonly accompanied by 'BEAUti 2', 'Tracer' and 'DensiTree'.
    'babette' provides for an alternative workflow of using 
    all these tools separately. This allows doing complex Bayesian
    phylogenetics easily and reproducibly from 'R'.
