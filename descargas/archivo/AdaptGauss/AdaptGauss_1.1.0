Description: Multimodal distributions can be modelled as a mixture of components. The model is derived using the Pareto Density Estimation (PDE) for an estimation of the pdf. PDE has been designed in particular to identify groups/classes in a dataset. Precise limits for the classes can be calculated using the theorem of Bayes. Verification of the model is possible by QQ plot, Chi-squared test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
