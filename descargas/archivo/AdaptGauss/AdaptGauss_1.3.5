Description: Multimodal distributions can be modelled as a mixture of components. The model is derived using the Pareto Density Estimation (PDE) for an estimation of the pdf. PDE has been designed in particular to identify groups/classes in a dataset. Precise limits for the classes can be calculated using the theorem of Bayes. Verification of the model is possible by QQ plot, Chi-squared test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The package is based on the publication of Ultsch, A., Thrun, M.C., Hansen-Goos, O., Lotsch, J. (2015)  <DOI:10.3390/ijms161025897>.
