Description: Provides several functions to identify and analyse miRNA sponge, including
             popular methods for identifying miRNA sponge interactions, two types 
             of global ceRNA regulation prediction methods and three types of context-specific 
             prediction methods( Li Y et al.(2017) <doi:10.1093/bib/bbx137>), which are based 
             on miRNA-messenger RNA regulation alone, or by integrating heterogeneous data, 
             respectively. In addition, this package provides several network analysis modules 
             for viewing the constructed ceRNA-ceRNA network and analysis of the topological features.
