Description: Set operations for many sets. The base functions for set
    operations in R are good for only two sets. This package uses
    'purrr' to find the union, intersection and difference of three
    or more sets. Further, based on 'ggplot2' and 'ggforce', Venn
    diagram can be drawn for two or three sets (Venn diagrams with four or more
    sets are terrible, please use 'UpSet' if you have lots of sets).
    Finally, enrichment test can be applied to two sets whether an overlap is
    statistically significant or not.
