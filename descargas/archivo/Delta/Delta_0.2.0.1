Description: Measure of agreement delta was originally by Mart√≠n & Femia (2004) <DOI:10.1348/000711004849268>. 
    Since then has been considered as agreement measure for different 
    fields, since their behavior is usually better than the usual kappa index
    by Cohen (1960) <DOI:10.1177/001316446002000104>. The main issue with delta 
    is that can not be computed by hand contrary to kappa. The current algorithm
    is based on the Version 5 of the delta windows program that can be found on
    <https://www.ugr.es/~bioest/software/delta/cmd.php?seccion=downloads>.
