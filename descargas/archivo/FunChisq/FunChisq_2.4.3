Description: Statistical hypothesis testing methods for
 non-parametric functional dependencies using asymptotic
 chi-square or exact distributions. Functional chi-squares are
 asymmetric and functionally optimal, unique from other related
 statistics. Tests in this package reveal evidence for causality 
 based on the causality-by-functionality principle. They include
 asymptotic functional chi-square tests, an exact functional
 test, a comparative functional chi-square test, and also a
 comparative chi-square test. The normalized non-constant
 functional chi-square test was used by Best Performer
 NMSUSongLab in HPN-DREAM (DREAM8) Breast Cancer Network
 Inference Challenges. For continuous data, these tests offer an
 advantage over regression analysis when a parametric functional
 form cannot be assumed; for categorical data, they provide a
 novel means to assess directional dependencies not possible with
 symmetrical Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact tests.
