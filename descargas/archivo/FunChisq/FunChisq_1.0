Description: The package implements non-constant functional chi-square tests (Zhang and Song, 2013). Such tests offer an advantage over regression analysis when a parametric form cannot be reliably assumed for the underlying function. It requires data from two or more variables be formatted as a contingency table. Continuous variables must be discretized first which can be done by using the Ckmeans.1d.dp function.
