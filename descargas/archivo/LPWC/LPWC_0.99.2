Author: Thevaa Chandereng <chandereng@wisc.edu>, Anthony Gitter
Maintainer: Thevaa Chandereng <chandereng@wisc.edu>
Description: Computes a time series distance measure for clustering based on weighted correlation and introduction of lags. The lags capture delayed responses in a time series dataset. The timepoints must be specified. T. Chandereng, A. Gitter (2018) <doi:10.1101/292615>.
