Description: Four measures of linkage disequilibrium are provided: the usual r^2
        measure, the r^2_S measure (r^2 corrected by the structure
        sample), the r^2_V (r^2 corrected by the relatedness of
        genotyped individuals), the r^2_VS measure (r^2 corrected by
        both the relatedness of genotyped individuals and the structure
        of the sample).
