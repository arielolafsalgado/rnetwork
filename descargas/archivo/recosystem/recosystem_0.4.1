Description: R wrapper of the 'libmf' library
    (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libmf/) for recommender
    system using matrix factorization. It is typically used to
    approximate an incomplete matrix using the product of two
    matrices in a latent space. Other common names for this task
    include "collaborative filtering", "matrix completion",
    "matrix recovery", etc. High performance multi-core parallel
    computing is supported in this package.
