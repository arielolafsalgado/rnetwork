Title: Create Waterfall Charts
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Hugh Parsonage
Maintainer: Hugh Parsonage <hugh.parsonage+waterfall@gmail.com>
Description: There seems to be no simple way to create 'waterfall charts' in 'ggplot2' currently. This package contains a single function (waterfall) that draws simply a waterfall chart as a 'ggplot2' object. Some flexibility in the appearance is available.
