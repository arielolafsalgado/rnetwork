Description: Perform differential analysis for
        methylation array data. Detect differentially
        methylated regions (DMRs) from array M-values. 
        The core is a Non-homogeneous Hidden Markov Model
        for estimating spatial correlation and a novel Constrained 
        Gaussian Mixture Model for modeling the M-value pairs of each individual locus.
