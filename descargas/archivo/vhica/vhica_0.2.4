Description: The "Vertical and Horizontal Inheritance Consistence Analysis" method is described in the following publication: "VHICA: a new method to discriminate between vertical and horizontal transposon transfer: application to the mariner family within Drosophila" by G. Wallau. et al. (2016) <DOI:10.1093/molbev/msv341>. The purpose of the method is to detect horizontal transfers of transposable elements, by contrasting the divergence of transposable element sequences with that of regular genes.
