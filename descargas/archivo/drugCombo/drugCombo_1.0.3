        Harbron's Approach

Description: Perform assessment of synergy/antagonism for drug combinations based
    on the Loewe additivity model, following Harbron's approach (Statistics in
    Medicine, 2010, <doi:10.1002/sim.3916>). The package allows flexible modeling
    of the drug interaction index and supports "2-stage" estimation in addition 
    to "1-stage" estimation, including bootstrap-based confidence intervals.
    The method requires data on the monotherapy responses and the package 
    accommodates both checkerboard and ray designs. Functions are available for 
    graphical exploration of model goodness-of-fit and diagnostics, as well as 
    for synergy/antagonism assessment in 2D and 3D.
