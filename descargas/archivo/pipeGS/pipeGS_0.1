Title: Permutation p-Value Estimation for Gene Set Tests
Description: Code for various permutation p-values estimation methods for gene set test. The description of corresponding methods can be found in the dissertation of Yu He(2016) "Efficient permutation P-value estimation for gene set tests" <https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11849351>. One of the methods also corresponds to the paper "Permutation p-value approximation via generalized Stolarsky invariance" <https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02757>.
