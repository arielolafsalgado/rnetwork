Description: Deep Gaussian mixture models as proposed by Viroli and McLachlan (2019) 
    <doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9793-z> provide a generalization of classical Gaussian mixtures 
    to multiple layers. Each layer contains a set of latent variables that follow 
    a mixture of Gaussian distributions. To avoid overparameterized solutions, dimension 
    reduction is applied at each layer by way of factor models.
