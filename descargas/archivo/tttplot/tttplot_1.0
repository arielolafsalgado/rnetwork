Description: Implementation of Time to Target plot based on the work 
             of Ribeiro and Rosseti (2015) <DOI:10.1007/s11590-014-0760-8>, 
             that describe a numerical method that gives the probability of 
             an algorithm A finds a solution at least as good as a given 
             target value in smaller computation time than algorithm B.
