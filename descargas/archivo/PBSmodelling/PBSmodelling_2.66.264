Description: PBS Modelling provides software to facilitate the design,
     testing, and operation of computer models. It focuses particularly on
     tools that make it easy to construct and edit a customized graphical
     user interface (GUI). Although it depends heavily on the R interface
     to the Tcl/Tk package, a user does not need to know Tcl/Tk. The
     package contains examples that illustrate models built with other R
     packages, including PBSmapping, deSolve, PBSddesolve, and BRugs. 
     It also serves as a convenient prototype for building new R packages, 
     along with instructions and batch files to facilitate that process. 
     The R directory '.../library/PBSmodelling/doc' offers a complete user 
     guide PBSmodelling-UG.pdf. To use this package effectively, 
     please consult the guide.
