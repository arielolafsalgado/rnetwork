Description: We propose a procedure for sample size calculation while
    controlling false discovery rate for RNA-seq experimental design. Our
    procedure depends on the Voom method proposed for RNA-seq data analysis
    by Law et al. (2014) <DOI:10.1186/gb-2014-15-2-r29> and the sample size 
    calculation method proposed for microarray experiments by Liu and Hwang 
    (2007) <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btl664>. We develop a set of functions
    that calculates appropriate sample sizes for two-sample t-test for RNA-seq
    experiments with fixed or varied set of parameters. The outputs also contain a
    plot of power versus sample size, a table of power at different sample sizes,
    and a table of critical test values at different sample sizes.
