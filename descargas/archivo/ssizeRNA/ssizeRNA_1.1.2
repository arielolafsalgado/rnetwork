Description: We propose a procedure for sample size calculation while controlling false discovery rate for RNA-seq experimental design. Our procedure depends on the Voom method proposed for RNA-seq data analysis by Law et al. (2014) and the sample size calculation method proposed for microarray experiments by Liu and Hwang (2007). We develop a set of functions that calculates appropriate sample sizes for two-sample t-test for RNA-seq experiments with fixed or varied set of parameters. The outputs also contain a plot of power versus sample size, a table of power at different sample sizes, and a table of critical test values at different sample sizes.
