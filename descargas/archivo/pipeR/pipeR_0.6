Title: Multi-paradigm Pipeline Implementation
Version: 0.6
Author: Kun Ren <ken@renkun.me>
Maintainer: Kun Ren <ken@renkun.me>
Description: Provides various styles of function chaining methods: Pipe
    operator, Pipe object, and pipeline function, each representing a distinct
    pipeline model yet sharing almost a common set of features: A value can be
    piped to the first unnamed argument of a function and to dot symbol in an
    enclosed expression. The syntax is designed to make the pipeline more
    readable and friendly to a wide range of operations.
Depends: R (>= 2.15)
