Description: Fitting a principal curve to data lying in the spherical surface.
    This package provides principal circle, principal geodesic analysis, Hauberg's      
    principal curves, and spherical principal curves. Moreover, it partially offers locally   
    defined principal geodesics which are currently under study. The detailed procedure 
    is described in Jang-Hyun Kim, Jongmin Lee and Hee-Seok Oh (2020) <arXiv:2003.02578>.
