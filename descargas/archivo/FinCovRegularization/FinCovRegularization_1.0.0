Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Yachen", "Yan", email = "yanyachen21@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Estimation and regularization for covariance matrix of asset returns. For covariance matrix estimation, 
    three major types of factor models are included: macroeconomic factor model, fundamental factor model and statistical 
    factor model. For covariance matrix regularization, four regularized estimators are included: banding, tapering, 
    hard-thresholding and soft-thresholding. The tuning parameters of these regularized estimators are selected via 
    cross-validation.
