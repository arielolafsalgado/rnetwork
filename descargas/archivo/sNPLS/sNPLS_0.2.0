Description: Tools for performing variable selection in three-way data using N-PLS 
    in combination with L1 penalization. The N-PLS model (Rasmus Bro, 1996 
    <DOI:10.1002/(SICI)1099-128X(199601)10:1%3C47::AID-CEM400%3E3.0.CO;2-C>) is the 
    natural extension of PLS (Partial Least Squares) to N-way structures, and tries 
    to maximize the covariance between X and Y data arrays. The package also adds
    variable selection through L1 penalization.
