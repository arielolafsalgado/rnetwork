Description: A tool to process and analyse data collected
  with wearable raw acceleration sensors. The package has been developed and
  tested for binary data from GENEActiv and GENEA devices and .csv-export data
  from  Actigraph devices. These devices are currently widely used in research on
  human daily physical activity
