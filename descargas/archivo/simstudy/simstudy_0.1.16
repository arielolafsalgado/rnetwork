Description: Simulates data sets in order to explore modeling techniques or
    better understand data generating processes. The user specifies a set of
    relationships between covariates, and generates data based on these
    specifications. The final data sets can represent data from randomized
    control trials, repeated measure (longitudinal) designs, and cluster
    randomized trials. Missingness can be generated using various
    mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, NMAR).
