Description: Finding locally D-optimal, minimax D-optimal, standardized maximin D-optimal, optim-on-the-average and multiple objective optimal designs for nonlinear models. Different Fisher information matrices can also be set by user. There are also  useful functions for verifying the optimality of the designs with respect to different criteria by equivalence theorem. ICA is a meta-heuristic evolutionary algorithm inspired from the socio-political process of humans. See Masoudi et al. (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2016.06.014>.
