Description: Contains different algorithms for efficient Latin Hypercube Designs (LHDs) with flexible sizes. Our package is comprehensive since it is capable of generating nearly orthogonal LHDs, maximin distance LHDs, and maximum projection LHDs. Documentation for each algorithm includes useful information and explanation along with corresponding references. This package is particularly useful in the area of Design and Analysis of Experiments (DAE). More specifically, design of computer experiments.
