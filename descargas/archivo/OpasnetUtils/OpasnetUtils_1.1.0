Description: This package is primarily developed for executing open assessments and modeling in Opasnet environment (http://www.opasnet.org).
  The operating principle of this package is maximum openness and modularity. Variables are defined publicly on wiki pages using wiki inputs/tables, 
  our database and R code. Using any predefined variable is very easy: fetch the variable from our servers (or your own) and evaluate it. Actual 
  evaluation of variables is done lazily by default: when the evaluation of a variable is explicitly called, all variables it is dependent 
  on are evaluated recursively. There are also a couple of impact assessment tools such as GIS functions in the package.
