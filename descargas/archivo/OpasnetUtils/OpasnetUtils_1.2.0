Author: Teemu Rintala, Einari Happonen, Jouni Tuomisto

Description: Contains tools for open assessment and modelling in Opasnet,
 a wiki-based web site and workspace for societal decision making
 (see <http://en.opasnet.org/w/Main_Page> for more information).
 The core principle of the workspace is maximal openness and modularity.
 Variables are defined on public wiki pages using wiki inputs/tables,
 databases and R code. This package provides the functionality to download and use these
 variables. It also contains health impact assessment tools such as
 spatial methods for exposure modelling.
