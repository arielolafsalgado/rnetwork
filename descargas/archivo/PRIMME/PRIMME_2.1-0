Description: 
    R interface to PRIMME, a C library for computing a few
    eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of a real symmetric or complex
    Hermitian matrix.  It can also compute singular values and vectors of a square
    or rectangular matrix.  It can find largest, smallest, or interior
    singular/eigenvalues and can use preconditioning to accelerate convergence.
