Description: C++ classes to embed R in C++ applications
 The 'RInside' packages makes it easier to have "R inside" your C++ application
 by providing a C++ wrapper class providing the R interpreter.
 .
   As R itself is embedded into your application, a shared library build of R
 is required. This works on Linux, OS X and even on Windows provided you use
 the same tools used to build R itself.  
 .
   Numerous examples are provided in the eight subdirectories of the examples/
 directory of the installed package: standard, mpi (for parallel computing)
 qt (showing how to embed 'RInside' inside a Qt GUI application), wt (showing
 how to build a "web-application" using the Wt toolkit), armadillo (for
 'RInside' use with 'RcppArmadillo') and eigen (for 'RInside' use with 'RcppEigen').
 The example use GNUmakefile(s) with GNU extensions, so a GNU make is required
 (and will use the GNUmakefile automatically).
 .
   Doxygen-generated documentation of the C++ classes is available at the
 'RInside' website as well.
