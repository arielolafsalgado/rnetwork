Description: 
	Provides functions to apply pooling or backward selection 
	for logistic or Cox regression prediction models in multiple imputed
	datasets. Backward selection can be done from the pooled model using 
	Rubin's Rules (RR), the total covariance matrix (D1 method), pooling 
	chi-square values (D2 method), pooling likelihood ratio statistics	
	(D3) or pooling the median p-values. The model can contain 
	continuous, dichotomous, categorical predictors and interaction terms 
	between all	type of these predictors. Continuous predictors	can also 
	be introduced as restricted cubic spline coefficients. It is also possible 
	to force (spline) predictors or interaction terms in the model during predictor 
	selection. The package also contains functions to generate apparent model performance 
	measures over imputed datasets as ROC/AUC, R-squares, fit test values and 
	calibration	plots. A wrapper function	over Frank Harrell's validate function 
	is used for that. Bootstrap internal validation is performed in each imputed dataset 
	and results are pooled. Backward selection as part of internal validation	
	is optional and recommended. Also a function to externally validate logistic
	prediction models in multiple imputed datasets is available.
