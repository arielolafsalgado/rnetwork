Description: A wrapper for The Cancer Imaging Archive's REST API. The Cancer
    Imaging Archive (TCIA) hosts de-identified medical images of cancer
    available for public download, as well as rich metadata for each image
    series. TCIA provides a REST API for programmatic access to the data.
    This package provides simple functions to access each API endpoint.
