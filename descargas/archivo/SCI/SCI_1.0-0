Description: Functions for generating Standardized Climate Indices (SCI). 
		SCI is a transformation of (smoothed) climate (or environmental)
		time series that  removes seasonality and forces the data to
		take values of the standard normal distribution. SCI was 
		originally developed for precipitation. In this case it is 
		known as the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI).
