Title: 'Rcpp' Bindings for the 'simdjson' Header-Only Library for
        'JSON' Parsing
Version: 0.0.4

Description: The 'JSON' format is ubiquitous for data interchange, and the
 'simdjson' library written by Daniel Lemire (and many contributors) provides 
 a high-performance parser for these files which by relying on parallel 'SIMD'
 instruction manages to parse these files as faster than disk speed. See the
 <arXiv:1902.08318> paper for more details about 'simdjson'.  This package is
 at present only a very thin and incomplete wrapper and does not aim to replace
 the existing and excellent 'JSON' packages for R. But it does already validate
 orders of magnitude faster.
