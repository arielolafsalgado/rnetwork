Description: Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) is a technology to determine the binding kinetics between biomolecule. BLI signals are small and noisy when small molecule ligands are investigated. We develop this package to process and analyze the BLI data acquired on Octet Red96 (Fortebio) more accurately.
