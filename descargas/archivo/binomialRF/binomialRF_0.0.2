Description: The 'binomialRF' is a new feature selection technique for decision trees that aims at providing an alternative approach to identify significant feature subsets using binomial distributional assumptions (Rachid Zaim, S., et al. (2019)) <doi:10.1101/681973>. Treating each splitting variable selection as a set of exchangeable correlated Bernoulli trials, 'binomialRF' then tests whether a feature is selected more often than by random chance.
