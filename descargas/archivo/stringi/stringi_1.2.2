Version: 1.2.2

Title: Character String Processing Facilities
Description: Allows for fast, correct, consistent, portable,
    as well as convenient character string/text processing in every locale
    and any native encoding. Owing to the use of the 'ICU' library,
    the package provides 'R' users with platform-independent functions
    known to 'Java', 'Perl', 'Python', 'PHP', and 'Ruby' programmers. Available
    features include: pattern searching (e.g., with 'Java'-like regular
    expressions or the 'Unicode' collation algorithm), random string generation,
    case mapping, string transliteration, concatenation,
    Unicode normalization, date-time formatting and parsing, and many more.
