Description: Node harvest is a simple interpretable tree-like estimator for high-dimensional regression and classification. A few nodes are selected from an initially large ensemble of nodes, each associated with a positive weight. New observations can fall into one or several nodes and predictions are the weighted average response across all these groups. The package offers visualization of the estimator. Predictions can return the nodes a new observation fell into, along with the mean response of training observations in each node, offering a simple explanation of the prediction.
