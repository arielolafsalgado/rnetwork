Description: Dynamic treatment regime estimation and inference via G-estimation,
    dynamic weighted ordinary least squares (dWOLS) and Q-learning. Inference
    via bootstrap and (for G-estimation) recursive sandwich estimation. The authors
    thank Gabrielle Simoneau of McGill University for identifying (and fixing) some
    errors in an earlier version of the code.
