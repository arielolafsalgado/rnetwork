Description: Provides functions for the selection of thresholds for use in 
    extreme value models, based mainly on the methodology in 
    Northrop, Attalides and Jonathan (2017) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12159>.
    It also performs predictive inferences about future extreme values, 
    based either on a single threshold or on a weighted average of inferences 
    from multiple thresholds, using the 'revdbayes' package 
    <https://cran.r-project.org/package=revdbayes>.   
    At the moment only the case where the data can be treated as 
    independent identically distributed observations is considered.
