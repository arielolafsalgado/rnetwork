Description: Generates time-to-event family data associated with mutated genes arising from various family study designs such as population-based, clinic- based, or multi-stage designs and provides functions to fit family data accounting for the study design and estimate age-dependent penetrance functions. It also provides carrier probabilities for those with missing genotypes and penetrance estimations are based on an Expectation-Maximization algorithm when genotypes are missing.
