Description: RWebLogo is a wrapper R package for the WebLogo python package
    that allows generating of customised sequence logos. Sequence logos are
    graphical representations of the sequence conservation of nucleotides (in a
    strand of DNA/RNA) or amino acids (in protein sequences). Each logo
    consists of stacks of symbols, one stack for each position in the sequence.
    The overall height of the stack indicates the sequence conservation at that
    position, while the height of symbols within the stack indicates the
    relative frequency of each amino or nucleic acid at that position. In
    general, a sequence logo provides a richer and more precise description of,
    for example, a binding site, than would a consensus sequence.
