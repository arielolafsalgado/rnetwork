Title: Data and Methods Around Reference Values in Pediatrics
Version: 0.7.0
Authors@R: person("Mandy", "Vogel", email = "mandy.vogel@googlemail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Calculation of standard deviation scores and percentiles adduced from different
    growth standards (WHO, UK, Germany, Italy, China, etc). Therefore, the calculation of SDS-values
    for different measures like BMI, weight, height, head circumference, different
    ratios, etc. are easy to carry out. Also, references for laboratory values in
    children and adults are available, e.g., serum lipids, iron-related blood parameters, IGF, liver enzymes. In the
    new version, there are also functions combining the lms() function from package 'gamlss' with
    resampling methods for using with repeated measurements and family dependencies. A searchable list
    of items can be found here: <https://github.com/mvogel78/childsds/wiki>.
