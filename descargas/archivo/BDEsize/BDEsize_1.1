Description: Provides the sample size in balanced design of experiments and three graphs ; detectable standardized effect size vs power, sample size vs detectable standardized effect size, and sample size vs power. 
             Sample size is computed in order to detect a certain standardized effect size with power at the significance level. 
             Three graphs show the mutual relationship between the sample size, power and the detectable standardized effect size. 
             By investigating those graphs, it can be checked that which effects are sensitive to the efficient sample size determination.
