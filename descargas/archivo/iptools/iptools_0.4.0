Description: A toolkit for manipulating, validating and testing 'IP' addresses and
    ranges, along with datasets relating to 'IP' addresses. Tools are also provided
    to map 'IPv4' blocks to country codes. While it primarily has support for the 'IPv4'
    address space, more extensive 'IPv6' support is intended.
