Description: A collection of multivariate nonparametric methods, selected in part to support an MS level course in nonparametric statistical methods. Methods include adjustments for multiple comparisons, implementation of multivariate Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon testing, inversion of these tests to produce a confidence region, some permutation tests for linear models, and some algorithms for calculating exact probabilities associated with one- and two- stage testing involving Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistics.
