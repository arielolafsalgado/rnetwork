Description: A collection of multivariate nonparametric methods, selected in
    part to support an MS level course in nonparametric statistical methods. Methods
    include adjustments for multiple comparisons, implementation of multivariate
    Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon testing, inversion of these tests to produce a confidence
    region, some permutation tests for linear models, and some algorithms for
    calculating exact probabilities associated with one- and two- stage testing
    involving Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon statistics.
