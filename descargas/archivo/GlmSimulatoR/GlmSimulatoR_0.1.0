Title: Creates Ideal Data for Generalized Linear Models
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Greg McMahan
Maintainer: Greg McMahan <gmcmacran@gmail.com>
Description: Have you ever struggled to find "good data" for a generalized linear model? Would you like
    to test how quickly statistics converge to parameters, or learn how picking different
    link functions affects model performance? This package creates ideal data for both common
    and novel generalized linear models so your questions can be empirically answered.
