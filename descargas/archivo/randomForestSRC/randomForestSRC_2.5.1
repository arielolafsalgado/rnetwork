Description: A unified treatment of Breiman's random forests for survival, regression and classification problems based on Ishwaran and Kogalur's random survival forests (RSF) package.  Now extended to include multivariate and unsupervised forests.  Also includes quantile regression forests for univariate and multivariate training/testing settings.  The package runs in both serial and parallel (OpenMP) modes.
