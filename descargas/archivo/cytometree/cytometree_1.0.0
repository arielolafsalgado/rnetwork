Description: Given the hypothesis of a bimodal distribution of cells for each
 marker, the algorithm constructs a binary tree, the nodes of which are subpopulations of cells.
 At each node, observed cells and markers are modeled by both a family of
 normal distributions and a family of bimodal normal mixture distributions.
 Splitting is done according to a normalized difference of AIC between
 the two families.
