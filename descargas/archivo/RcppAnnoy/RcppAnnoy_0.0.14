Description: 'Annoy' is a small C++ library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors 
 written for efficient memory usage as well an ability to load from / save to
 disk. This package provides an R interface by relying on the 'Rcpp' package,
 exposing the same interface as the original Python wrapper to 'Annoy'. See
 <https://github.com/spotify/annoy> for more on 'Annoy'. 'Annoy' is released
 under Version 2.0 of the Apache License. Also included is a small Windows
 port of 'mmap' which is released under the MIT license.
