Description: Annoy is a small C++ library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors 
 written for efficient memory usage as well an ability to load from / save to
 disk. This package provides an R interface by relying on the Rcpp and BH
 packages, exposing the same interface as the original Python wrapper to
 Annoy. See https://github.com/spotify/annoy for more on Annoy. Annoy is
