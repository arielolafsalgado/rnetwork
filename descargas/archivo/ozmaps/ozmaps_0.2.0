Title: Australia Maps
Description: Maps of Australian coastline and administrative regions. Data 
 can be drawn or accessed directly as simple features objects. Includes
 simple functions for country or state maps of Australia and in-built data
 sets of administrative regions from the Australian Bureau of Statistics 
 <https://www.abs.gov.au/>. Layers include electoral divisions and local 
 government areas, simplified from the original sources but with sufficient 
 detail to allow mapping of a local municipality.
