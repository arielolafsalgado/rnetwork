Description: Inference functionalities for distributed-lag linear structural equation models (DLSEMs). DLSEMs are Markovian structural causal models where each factor of the joint probability distribution is a distributed-lag linear regression model (Magrini, 2018) <doi:10.2478/bile-2018-0012>. DLSEMs account for temporal delays in the dependence relationships among the variables and allow to perform dynamic causal inference by assessing causal effects at different time lags. Endpoint-constrained quadratic, quadratic decreasing and gamma lag shapes are available.
