Description: Inference functionalities for distributed-lag linear structural equation models (DLSEMs). DLSEMs are Markovian structural causal models (Pearl, 2000, Chapter 5) <ISBN:978-0-521-89560-6>, where each factor of the joint probability distribution is a distributed-lag linear regression model (Judge et al., 1985, Chapters 9-10) <ISBN: 978-0-471-89530-5>. DLSEMs account for temporal delays in the dependence relationships among the variables and allow to perform dynamic causal inference by assessing causal effects at different time lags. Endpoint-constrained quadratic, quadratic decreasing and gamma lag shapes are available.
