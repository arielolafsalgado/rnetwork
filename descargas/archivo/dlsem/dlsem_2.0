Description: Inference functionalities for distributed-lag linear structural equation models (DLSEMs). DLSEMs were recently proposed by Magrini et al. (2016) <ISBN:978-88-619-7061-8> as an extension of linear structural causal models (Pearl, 2000) <ISBN:978-0-521-89560-6>, where each factor of the joint probability distribution is a distributed-lag linear regression with constrained lag shapes. Endpoint-constrained quadratic, quadratic decreasing and gamma lag shapes are available.
