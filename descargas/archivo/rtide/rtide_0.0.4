Description: Calculates tide heights based on tide station harmonics.
    It includes the harmonics data for 637 US stations.
    The harmonics data was converted from <ftp://ftp.flaterco.com/xtide/harmonics-dwf-20151227-free.tar.bz2>,
    which is NOAA web site data processed by David Flater for XTide.
    The code to calculate tide heights from the harmonics is based on XTide.
