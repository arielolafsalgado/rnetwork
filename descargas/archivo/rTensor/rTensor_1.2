Description: rTensor is a set of tools for creation, manipulation, and modeling
    of tensors with arbitrary number of modes. A tensor in the context of data
    analysis is a multidimensional array. rTensor does this by providing a S4
    class 'Tensor' that wraps around the base 'array' class. rTensor also
    provides common tensor operations as methods, including matrix unfolding,
    summing/averaging across modes, calculating the Frobenius norm, and taking
    the inner product between two tensors. Familiar array operations are
    overloaded, such as index subsetting via '[' and element-wise operations.
    rTensor also implements various tensor decomposition, including CP, GLRAM,
    MPCA, PVD, and Tucker. For tensors with 3 modes, rTensor also implements
    transpose, product, and SVD, as defined in Kilmer et al. (2013). Some
    auxiliary functions include the Khatri-Rao product, Kronecker product, and
    the Hamadard product for a list of matrices. Development of rTensor has
    been generously supported by Cornell's Department of Statistical Science.
