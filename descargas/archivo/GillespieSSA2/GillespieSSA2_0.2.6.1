Description: A fast, scalable, and versatile framework for simulating large 
  systems with Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm ('SSA'). 
  This package is the spiritual successor to the 'GillespieSSA' package 
  originally written by Mario Pineda-Krch. Benefits of this package
  include major speed improvements (>100x), easier to understand documentation,
  and many unit tests that try to ensure the package works as intended.
