Description: Heller-Heller-Gorfine (HHG) tests are a set of powerful statistical tests of multivariate k-sample homogeneity and independence. For the univariate case, the package also offers implementations of the MinP DDP and MinP ADP tests, which are consistent against all continuous alternatives but are distribution-free, and are thus much faster to apply.
