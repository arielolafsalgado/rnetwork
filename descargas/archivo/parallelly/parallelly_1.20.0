Description: Utility functions that enhances the 'parallel' packages and that are used for the built-in parallel backends of the 'future' package.  For example, availableCores() gives the number of CPU cores available to your R process as given by relevant R options and environment variables including those set by job schedulers on high-performance compute clusters. If none is set, it will fall back to parallel::detectCores(). Another example is makeClusterPSOCK(), which is backward compatible with parallel::makePSOCKcluster() while doing a better job in setting up a remote cluster workers without the need for configuring the firewall to do port-forwarding to your local computer.
