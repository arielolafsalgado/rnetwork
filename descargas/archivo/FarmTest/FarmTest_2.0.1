Description: Performs robust multiple testing for means in the presence of known and unknown latent factors (Fan et al., 2019).
             It implements a series of adaptive Huber methods combined with fast data-drive tuning schemes (Ke et al., 2019) to estimate model parameters and construct test statistics that are robust against heavy-tailed and/or asymmetric error distributions. 
             Extensions to two-sample simultaneous mean comparison problems are also included. 
             As by-products, this package also contains functions that compute adaptive Huber mean and covariance matrix estimators that are of independent interest.
