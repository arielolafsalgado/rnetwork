Description: Computes nonparametric p-values for the potential class
        memberships of new observations as well as cross-validated
        p-values for the training data. The p-values are based on
        permutation tests applied to an estimated Bayesian likelihood
        ratio, using a plug-in statistic for the Gaussian model, 'k
        nearest neighbors', 'weighted nearest neighbors' or
        'penalized logistic regression'.
        Additionally, it provides graphical displays and quantitative
        analyses of the p-values.
