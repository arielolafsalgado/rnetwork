Description: Distances on dual-weighted directed graphs using priority-queue
    shortest paths. Weighted directed graphs have weights from A to B which may
    differ from those from B to A. Dual-weighted directed graphs have two sets
    of such weights. A canonical example is a street network to be used for
    routing in which routes are calculated by weighting distances according to
    the type of way and mode of transport, yet lengths of routes must be
    calculated from direct distances.
