Title: Intrinsic Dimension for Data Mining
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Jean Golay and Mohamed Laib
Maintainer: Jean Golay <Jean.Golay@unil.ch>
Description: Contains techniques for mining large high-dimensional data sets 
             by using the concept of Intrinsic Dimension (ID). Here the ID is 
             not necessarily integer. It is extended to fractal dimensions. And 
             the Morisita estimator is used for the ID estimation, but other 
             tools are included as well.
