Description: Based on the input data an n-dimensional cube with sub cells of user specified side length is created.
    The number of sample points which fall in each sub cube is counted, and with the cell volume and overall sample
    size an empirical probability can be computed. A number of cubes of higher resolution can be superimposed. The 
    basic method stems from J.L. Bentley in "Multidimensional Divide and Conquer".
