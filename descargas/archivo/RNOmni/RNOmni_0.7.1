Description: Genetic association tests that use the rank-based inverse normal transformation (INT). These tests are recommend for continuous traits with non-normally distributed residuals. INT-based tests robustly control the type I error in settings where standard linear regression does not. Moreover, INT-based tests dominate standard linear regression in terms of power. INT-based tests may be classified into two types: tests that directly transform the phenotype (D-INT) and tests that transform phenotypic residuals (I-INT). Our omnibus test (O-INT) adaptively combines D-INT and I-INT into a single robust and statistically powerful approach.
