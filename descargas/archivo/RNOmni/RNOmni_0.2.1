Description: Implementation of genetic association tests that utilize the rank based inverse normal transformation (INT). The primary contribution is an omnibus test, which synthesizes two complementary INT-based approaches. In simulations against phenotypes with skewed and heavy tailed residual distributions, the omnibus test provided valid inference in the absence of a genotypic effect, and provided power comparable to the more powerful of the component methods in the presence of a genotypic effect. Under these settings, standard linear regression often failed to control the type I error.
