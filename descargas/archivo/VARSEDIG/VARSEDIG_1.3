Title: An Algorithm for Morphometric Characters Selection and
        Statistical Validation in Morphological Taxonomy
Author: Cástor Guisande González
Maintainer: Cástor Guisande González <castor@uvigo.es>
Description: An algorithm (Guisande et al., 2016 <doi:10.11646/zootaxa.4162.3.10>) which identifies the morphometric features that significantly discriminate two taxa and validates the morphological distinctness between them via a Monte-Carlo test, polar coordinates and overlap of the area under the density curve.
