Description: Simplify the exploratory data analysis process for multiple network data sets with the help
             of hierarchical clustering and heatmaps. Contains the tools necessary to convert the raw data
             of multiple networks into a single dynamic report that summarizes many of the relationships
             of their graph, node and structural characteristics.
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
