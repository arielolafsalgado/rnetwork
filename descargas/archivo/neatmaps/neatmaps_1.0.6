Description: Simplify the exploratory data analysis process for multiple network data sets with the help
             of hierarchical clustering and heatmaps. Multiple network data consists of multiple disjoint
             networks that share common graph, node and edge variables. Contains the tools necessary to 
             convert this raw data into a single dynamic report, summarizing the relationships
             of the graph, node and structural characteristics of the networks.
