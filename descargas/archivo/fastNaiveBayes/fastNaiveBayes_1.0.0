Title: Extremely Fast Implementation of a Naive Bayes Classifier
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Martin Skogholt
Maintainer: Martin Skogholt <m.skogholt@gmail.com>
Description: This is an extremely fast implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier. 
    The package currently supports a Bernoulli distribution, a Multinomial distribution, and 
    a Gaussian distribution, making it suitable for both binary features, 
    frequency counts, and numerical features. Only numerical variables are allowed, 
    however, categorical variables can be transformed into dummies and used with 
    the Bernoulli distribution. The implementation is based on the paper 
    "A comparison of event models for Naive Bayes anti-spam e-mail filtering" written by 
    K.M. Schneider (2003) <doi:10.3115/1067807>. This implementation offers a huge performance 
    gain compared to the 'e1071' implementation in R. The execution times were compared 
    on a data set of tweets and was found to be 331 times faster. See the vignette 
    for more details. This performance gain is only realized using a Bernoulli 
    event model. Furthermore, the Multinomial event model is equally fast and 
    available in contrast to 'e1071'.
