Description: Formats for R Markdown that undo modifications by
    'pandoc' and 'rmarkdown' to original 'latex' templates, such as
    smaller margins, paragraph spacing, and compact titles. In addition, 
    enhancements such as author blocks with affiliations and
    headers and footers are introduced. All of this functionality is built 
    around plugins that modify the default 'pandoc' template without relying on 
    custom templates.
