Description: Creation of linkage maps in polyploid species from marker dosage
    scores of an F1 cross from two heterozygous parents. Currently works for autotriploid, autotetraploid and autohexaploid species, 
    as well as segmental allotetraploids. Methods are described in a preprint manuscript of Bourke et al. (2017) <doi:10.1101/228817>.
