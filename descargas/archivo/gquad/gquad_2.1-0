Description: Genomic biology is not limited to the confines of the canonical B-
    forming DNA duplex, but includes over ten different types of other secondary
    structures that are collectively termed non-B DNA structures. Of these non-B
    DNA structures, the G-quadruplexes are highly stable four-stranded structures
    that are recognized by distinct subsets of nuclear factors. This package
    provide functions for predicting intramolecular G quadruplexes. In addition, 
    functions for predicting other intramolecular nonB DNA structures are included.
