Description: Prepares variables so that data has fewer exceptional cases, making it easier to safely use models in production. Common problems 'vtreat' defends against: Inf, NA, too many categorical values, rare categorical values, new categorical values (levels seen during application, but not during training).   'vtreat::prepare' should be used as you would use 'model.matrix'.
