Description: Datasets, constants, conversion factors, and utilities for 'MArine', 'Riverine',
             'Estuarine', 'LAcustrine' and 'Coastal' science. 
             The package contains among others: (1) chemical and
             physical constants and datasets, e.g. atomic weights, gas
             constants, the earths bathymetry; (2) conversion factors
             (e.g. gram to mol to liter, barometric units,
             temperature, salinity); (3) physical functions, e.g. to
             estimate concentrations of conservative substances, gas
             transfer and diffusion coefficients, the Coriolis force
             and gravity; (4) thermophysical properties of the
             seawater, as from the UNESCO polynomial or from the more
             recent derivation based on a Gibbs function.
