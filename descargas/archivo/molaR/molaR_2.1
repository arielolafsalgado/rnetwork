Description: Surface topography calculations of Dirichlet's normal energy,
    relief index, and orientation patch count for teeth using scans of enamel caps.
    Importantly, for the relief index and orientation patch count calculations to
    work, the scanned tooth files must be oriented with the occlusal plane parallel
    to the x and y axes, and perpendicular to the z axis. The files should also be
    simplified, and smoothed in some other software prior to uploading into R.
