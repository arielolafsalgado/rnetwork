Description: Surface topography calculations of Dirichlet's normal energy, relief index, and orientation patch count for teeth using scans of enamel caps. Importantly, for the relief index and orientation patch count calculations to work, the scanned tooth files must be oriented with the occlusal plane parallel to the x and y axes, and perpendicular to the z axis. The files should also be simplified, and smoothed in some other software prior to uploading into R.
