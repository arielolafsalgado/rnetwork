Description: Implements stochastic simulations of community assembly (ecological
    diversification) using customizable ecospace frameworks (functional trait
    spaces). Provides a wrapper to calculate common ecological disparity and
    functional ecology statistical dynamics as a function of species richness. Functions are written so they will work in a
    parallel-computing environment.
