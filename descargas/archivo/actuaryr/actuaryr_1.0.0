Description: Actuarial reports are prepared for the last day of a specific 
    period, such as a month, a quarter or a year. Actuarial models assume that 
    certain events happen at the beginning or end of periods. The package 
    contains functions to easily refer the first or last (working) day 
    within a specific period relative to a base date to facilitate actuarial 
    reporting.
