Description: Filter CpGs based on Intra-class Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) when replicates are available. ICCs are calculated by fitting linear mixed effects models to all samples including the un-replicated samples. Including the large number of un-replicated samples improves ICC estimates dramatically. The method accommodates any replicate design.
