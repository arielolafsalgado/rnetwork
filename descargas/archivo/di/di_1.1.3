Description: A set of utilities for calculating the Deficit (frailty) Index (DI) in gerontological studies. 
             The deficit index was first proposed by Arnold Mitnitski and Kenneth Rockwood 
             and represents a proxy measure of aging and also can be served as
             a sensitive predictor of survival. For more information, see
