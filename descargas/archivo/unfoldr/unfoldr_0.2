Description: Stereological unfolding as implemented in this package consists in
			 the estimation of the joint size-shape-orientation distribution of spheroidal shaped
			 particles based on the same measured quantities of corresponding planar section
			 profiles. A single trivariate discretized version of the (stereological) integral
			 equation in the case of prolate and oblate spheroids is solved numerically by the 
			 EM algorithm. The estimation of diameter distribution of spheres from planar sections
			 (Wicksell's corpuscle problem) is also implemented. Further, the package provides routines
			 for the simulation of a Poisson germ-grain process with either spheroids or spheres as grains
			 together with functions for planar sections.
