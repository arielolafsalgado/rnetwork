Description: Stereological unfolding as implemented in this package consists in
    the estimation of the joint size-shape-orientation distribution of spheroidal
    shaped particles based on the same measured quantities of corresponding planar
    section profiles. A single trivariate discretized version of the (stereological)
    integral equation in the case of prolate and oblate spheroids is solved
    numerically by the EM algorithm. The estimation of diameter distribution of
    spheres from planar sections (Wicksell's corpuscle problem) is also implemented.
    Further, the package provides routines for the simulation of a Poisson germ-
    grain process with either spheroids, spherocylinders or spheres as grains together
    with functions for planar sections. For the purpose of exact simulation a bivariate size-shape
    distribution is implemented.
