Description: This is (1) An evolving and growing collection of tools for the quantification, assessment, and comparison of shape and pattern. The spatial decomposition of planar shapes using 'ShrinkShape' to incrementally shrink shapes to extinction while computing area, perimeter, and number of parts at each iteration of shrinking. The spectra of results are returned in graphic and tabular formats. Additional utility tools for handling data are provided and this package will be added to as more tools are created, cleaned-up, and documented. (2) Provision of tools for estimating composition and configuration parameters from a categorical (binary) landscape map (grid) and then simulates a selected number of statistically similar landscapes. Class-focused pattern metrics are computed for each simulated map to produce empirical distributions against which statistical comparisons can be made. The code permits the analysis of single maps or pairs of maps. Current limitation is for binary (classes 1, 2) maps that are 64x64 cells in extent. (3) Counting the number of each first-order pattern element and converting that information into both frequency and probability vectors. See Remmel (2018) <doi:10.3390/su10103413> and Remmel and Fortin (2013) <doi:10.1007/s10980-013-9905-x>. NOTE: This is a consolidation of existing packages ('PatternClass', 'ShapePattern') to begin warehousing all shape and pattern code in a common package. Note that all future developments will appear in this package and that 'PatternClass' will eventually be archived.
