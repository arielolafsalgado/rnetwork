Description: The core of this 'Rcpp' based package is several functions to
    compute the baseline hazard, effect parameter, and frailty variance for the
    discrete-time shared frailty model with random effects. The core functions
    include two processes: (1) evaluate the multiple variable integration to
    compute the exact proportional hazards model based likelihood and (2) estimate
    desired parameters using maximum likelihood estimation. The integration is
    evaluated by 'Cuhre' function from 'Cuba' library (Hahn, T., Cuba-a library
    for multidimensional numerical integration, Comput. Phys. Commun. 168, 2005,
    78-95 <doi: 10.1016/j.cpc.2005.01.010>), and the source files of 'Cuhre' function are included in this package.
    Maximization process is carried out using the Brent's algorithm, and the 'C+
    +' code file is from John Burkardt and John Denker (Brent, R.,Algorithms for
    Minimization without Derivatives, Dover, 2002, ISBN 0-486-41998-3).
