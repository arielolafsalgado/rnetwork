Description: Supports visualizing multiple sequence alignment of DNA and protein sequences using 'ggplot2'. It supports a number of colour schemes, including Chemistry, Clustal, Shapely, Taylor and Zappo. Multiple sequence alignment can easily be combined with other 'ggplot2' plots, such as aligning a phylogenetic tree produced by 'ggtree' with multiple sequence alignment.
