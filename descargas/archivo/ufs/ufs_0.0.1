Description: This is a new version of the 'userfriendlyscience' package,
    which has grown a bit unwieldy. This first submission contains a
    number of basic functions to easily format values, work with scales,
    and format vectors in a single character value. Over time, more
    functions presently in 'userfriendlyscience' will be migrated over
    to this package.
