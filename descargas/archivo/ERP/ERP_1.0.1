Description: The functions provided in the package ERP are designed for the significance analysis of ERP data in a linear model framework. The possible procedures are either the collection of FDR or FWER controlling methods available in the generic function p.adjust, the same collection combined with a factor modeling of the time dependence among tests (see Sheu, Perthame, Lee and Causeur, 2014) and the Guthrie and Buchwald (1991) test.
