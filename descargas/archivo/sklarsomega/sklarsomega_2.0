Description: Provides tools for applying Sklar's Omega (Hughes, 2018) <arXiv:1803.02734>
    methodology to nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio scores. The framework can
    accommodate any number of units, any number of coders, and missingness; and
    can be used to measure agreement with a gold standard, intra-coder agreement,
    and/or inter-coder agreement. Frequentist inference is supported for all levels
    of measurement. Bayesian inference is supported for interval and ratio scores.
