Description: Estimator augmentation methods for statistical inference on high-dimensional data, 
    as described in Zhou, Q. (2014) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2014.946035>
    and Zhou, Q. and Min, S. (2017) <doi:10.1214/17-EJS1309>.
    It provides several simulation-based inference methods: (a) Gaussian and 
    wild multiplier bootstrap for lasso, group lasso, scaled lasso, scaled group
    lasso and their de-biased estimators, (b) importance sampler for approximating
    p-values in these methods, (c) Markov chain Monte Carlo lasso sampler with 
    applications in post-selection inference.
