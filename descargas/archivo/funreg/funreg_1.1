Description: This package performs functional regression, and some related
    approaches, for intensive longitudinal data (see Walls & Schafer, 2006)
    which is not necessarily observed on an equally spaced grid of times.  The
    approach generally follows the ideas of Goldsmith, Bobb, Crainiceanu,
    Caffo, and Reich (2011) and the approach taken in their sample code, but
    with some modifications to make it more feasible to use with long rather
    than wide, non-rectangular longitudinal datasets with unequal and
    potentially random measurement times.  It also allows easy plotting of the
    correlation between the smoothed covariate and the outcome as a function of
    time, which can add additional insights on how to interpret a functional
    regression.  Additionally, it also provides several permutation tests for
    the significance of the functional predictor.  The heuristic interpretation
    of ``time'' is used to describe the index of the functional predictor, but
    the same methods can equally be used for another unidimensional continuous
    index, such as space along a north-south axis.  The development of this
    package was part of a research project supported by Award R03 CA171809-01
    from the National Cancer Institute and Award P50 DA010075 from the National
    Institute on Drug Abuse. The content is solely the responsibility of the
