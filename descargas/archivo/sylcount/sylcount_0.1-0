Title: Syllable Counting and Readability Measurements
Version: 0.1-0
Description: An English language syllable counter, plus readability score
    measure-er.  The package has been carefully optimized and should be very
    efficient, both in terms of run time performance and memory consumption.
    The main methods are 'vectorized' by document, and scores for multiple
    documents are computed in parallel via 'OpenMP'.
