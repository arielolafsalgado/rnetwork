Description: Symbolic Data Analysis (SDA) was proposed by professor Edwin Diday in 1987, the main purpose of SDA is to substitute the set of rows (cases) in the data table for  a concept (second order statistical unit). This package implements, to the symbolic case, certain techniques of automatic classification, as well as some linear models.
