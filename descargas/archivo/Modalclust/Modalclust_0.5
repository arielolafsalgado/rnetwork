Description: Performs Modal Clustering (MAC) including Hierarchical
        Modal Clustering (HMAC) along with their parallel
        implementation (PHMAC) over several processors.  These
        model-based non-parametric clustering techniques can extract
        clusters in very high dimensions with arbitrary density shapes.
        By default clustering is performed over several resolutions and
        the results are summarised as a hierarchical tree. Associated
        plot functions are also provided. There is a package vignette
        that provides many examples.
