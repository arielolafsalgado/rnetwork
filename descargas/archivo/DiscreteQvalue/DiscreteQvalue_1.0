Description: We consider a multiple testing procedure used in many modern applications which is the q-value method proposed by Storey and Tibshirani (2003) <DOI:10.1073/pnas.1530509100>. The q-value method is based on the false discovery rate (FDR), hence versions of the q-value method can be defined depending on which estimator of the proportion of true null hypotheses, pi_0, is plugged in the FDR estimator. We implement the q-value method based on two classical pi_0 estimators, and furthermore, we propose and implement three versions of the q-value method for homogeneous discrete uniform P-values based on pi_0 estimators which take into account the discrete distribution of the P-values.
