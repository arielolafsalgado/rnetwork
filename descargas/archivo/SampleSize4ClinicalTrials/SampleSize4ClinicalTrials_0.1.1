Description: There are four categories of Phase III clinical trials according to different research goals, including (1) Testing for equality, (2) Superiority trial, (3) Non-inferiority trial, and (4) Equivalence trial. This package aims to help researchers to calculate sample size when comparing means or proportions in Phase III clinical trials with different research goals. The ssc function can calculate the sample size with pre-specified type I error rate, statistical power and effect size.
