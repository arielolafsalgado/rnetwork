Description: Miscellaneous functions useful for teaching statistics as well as actually practicing the art. They typically are not “new” methods but rather wrappers around either base R or other packages. Currently contains: 'Plot2WayANOVA' which as the name implies conducts a 2 way ANOVA and plots the results using 'ggplot2'. 'neweta' which is a helper function that appends the results of a Type II eta squared calculation onto a classic ANOVA table. Mode which finds the modal value in a vector of data. 'SeeDist' which wraps around 'ggplot2' to provide visualizations of univariate data.
