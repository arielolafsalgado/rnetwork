Description: Performs the two-sample comparisons using the following exact test procedures: the exact likelihood-ratio test (LRT) for equality of two normal populations proposed in Zhang et al. (2012); the combined test based on the LRT and Shapiro-Wilk test for normality via the Bonferroni correction technique; the newly proposed density-based empirical likelihood (DBEL) ratio test. To calculate p-values of the DBEL procedures, three procedures are used: (a) the traditional Monte Carlo (MC) method implemented in C++, (b) a new interpolation method based on regression techniques to operate with tabulated critical values of the test statistic; (c) a Bayesian type method that uses the tabulated critical values as the prior information and  MC generated DBEL-test-statistic's values as data.
