Description: Tools to clean and process text.  Tools are geared at checking for substrings
          that are not optimal for analysis and replacing or removing them with more
          analysis friendly substrings. For example, emoticons are often used in text but
          not always easily handled by analysis algorithms.  The 'replace_emoticon' function
          replaces emoticons with word equivalents.
