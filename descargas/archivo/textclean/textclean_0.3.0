Description: Tools to clean and process text.  Tools are geared at checking for
        substrings that are not optimal for analysis and replacing or removing
        them with more analysis friendly substrings.  For example, emoticons
        are often used in text but not always easily handled by analysis
        algorithms.  The 'replace_emoticon' function replaces emoticons with
        word equivalents.
