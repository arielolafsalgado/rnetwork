Title: Systematic Identification of Bimodally Expressed Genes Using
        RNAseq Data
Version: 2.0.1
Author: Pan Tong, Kevin R. Coombes
Maintainer: Kevin R. Coombes <krc@silicovore.com>
Description: Provides models to identify bimodally expressed genes from
 RNAseq data based on the Bimodality Index. SIBERG models the  RNAseq data in
 the finite mixture modeling framework and incorporates mechanisms  for
 dealing with RNAseq normalization. Three types of mixture models are
 implemented,  namely, the mixture of log normal, negative binomial, or 
 generalized poisson distribution. See Tong et al. (2013)
