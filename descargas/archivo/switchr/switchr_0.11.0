Description: Provides an abstraction for managing, installing,
    and switching between sets of installed R packages. This allows users to
    maintain multiple package libraries simultaneously, e.g. to maintain
    strict, package-version-specific reproducibility of many analyses, or
    work within a development/production release paradigm. Introduces a
    generalized package installation process which supports multiple repository
    and non-repository sources and tracks package provenance.
