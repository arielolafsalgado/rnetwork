Description: Computes the expectation of the number of transmissions and receptions considering a Hop-by-Hop transport model with limited number of retransmissions per packet. It provides the theoretical results shown in Palma et. al.(2015) <DOI:10.1109/APCASE.2015.59> and also estimated values based on Monte Carlo simulations.
