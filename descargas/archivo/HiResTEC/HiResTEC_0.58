Description: Identifying labeled compounds in a 13C-tracer experiment in non-targeted fashion is a cumbersome process. This package facilitates such type of analyses
    by providing high level quality control plots, deconvoluting and evaluating spectra and performing a multitude of tests in an automatic fashion.
    The main idea is to use changing intensity ratios of ion pairs from peak list generated with 'xcms' as candidates and evaluate those against
    base peak chromatograms and spectra information within the raw measurement data automatically.
    The functionality is described in Hoffmann et al. (2018) <doi:10.1021/acs.analchem.8b00356>.
