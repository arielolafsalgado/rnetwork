Description: Multidimensional scaling models and methods for the visualization for asymmetric data. A matrix is asymmetric if the number of rows equals the number of columns, and these rows and columns refer to the same set of objects. An example is a  student migration table, where the rows correspond to the countries of origin of the students and the columns to the destination countries. This package provides the slide-vector model, a scaling model with unique dimensions and the asymscal model for asymmetric multidimensional scaling. Furthermore, a heat map for skew-symmetric data, and the decomposition of asymmetry are provided for the analysis of asymmetric tables.
