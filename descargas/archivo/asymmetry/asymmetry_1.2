Description: Models and methods for the visualization for asymmetric data. A matrix is asymmetric if the number of rows equals the number of columns, and these rows and columns refer to the same set of objects. An example is a  student migration table, where the rows correspond to the countries of origin of the students and the columns to the destination countries. The slide-vector model, a heat map, and the decomposition of asymmetry are provided for the analysis of these tables.
