Title: Shape Constrained Additive Models
Date: 2016-06-02
Description: Routines for generalized additive modelling under shape
        constraints on the component functions of the linear predictor.
        Models can contain multiple shape constrained (univariate
        and/or bivariate) and unconstrained terms. The routines of gam() 
        in package 'mgcv' are used for setting up the model matrix,  
        printing and plotting the results.  Penalized likelihood
        maximization based on Newton-Raphson method is used to fit a
        model with multiple smoothing parameter selection by GCV or
        UBRE/AIC.
Depends: R (>= 2.15.0), mgcv (>= 1.8-2)
Imports: methods, stats, graphics, Matrix, splines
