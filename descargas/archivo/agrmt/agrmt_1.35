Description: This package calculates agreement or consensus in ordered rating scales. It implements van der Eijk's (2001) measure of agreement A, which can be used to describe agreement, consensus, or polarization among respondents. It also implements measures of consensus (dispersion) by Leik, Tatsle and Wierman, Blair and Lacy, Kvalseth, and Berry and Mielke. Furthermore, an implementation of Galtungs AJUS-system is provided to classify distributions, as well as a function to identify the position of multiple modes.
