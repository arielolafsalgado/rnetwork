Description: Calculate agreement or consensus in ordered rating scales. The package implements van der Eijk's (2001) <DOI: 10.1023/A:1010374114305> measure of agreement A, which can be used to describe agreement, consensus, or polarization among respondents. It also implements measures of consensus (dispersion) by Leik, Tatsle and Wierman, Blair and Lacy, Kvalseth, Berry and Mielke, and Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol. Furthermore, an implementation of Galtungs AJUS-system is provided to classify distributions, as well as a function to identify the position of multiple modes.
