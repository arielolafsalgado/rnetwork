Description: Quantile Regression Forests is a tree-based ensemble
        method for estimation of conditional quantiles. It is
        particularly well suited for high-dimensional data. Predictor
        variables of mixed classes can be handled. The package is
        dependent on the package randomForests, written by Andy Liaw.
