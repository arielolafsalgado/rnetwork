Description: 
  Levels and changes of productivity and profitability are measured with various indices.
  In addition to the classic Malmquist productivity index, the 'productivity' package contains 
  also the multiplicatively complete Färe-Primont, Fisher, Laspeyres, Lowe, and Paasche indices. 
  Färe-Primont and Lowe indices verify the transitivity property and can therefore be used for 
  multilateral or multitemporal comparison.
  Fisher, Laspeyres, Malmquist, and Paasche indices are not transitive and are only to be used for 
  binary comparison. 
  All indices can also be decomposed into different components, providing insightful information 
  on the sources of productivity and profitability improvements. 
  In the use of Malmquist productivity index, the technological change index can be further 
  decomposed into bias technological change components. 
  In the case of the Fisher, Laspeyres, Paasche and the transitive Färe-Primont and Lowe indices, 
  it is furthermore possible to rule out technological change. Deflated shadow prices, used in 
  those indices' computations, are also returned.
  The package also allows to prohibit negative technological change. 
  All computations are carried out with the nonparametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), 
  and several assumptions regarding returns to scale are available.
  The package allows parallel computing as an option, depending on the user's computer configuration.
