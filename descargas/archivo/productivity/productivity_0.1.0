Description: 
  Various transitive measures of productivity and profitability, in levels and changes, are computed. 
  In addition to the classic Malmquist productivity index, the 'productivity' package contains also the 
  multiplicatively complete and transitive Färe-Primont and Lowe indices.
  These indices are also decomposed into different components providing insightful information on 
  the sources of productivity and profitability improvements. 
  In the use of Malmquist productivity index, the technological change index is further decomposed 
  into bias technological change components.
  For the transitive Färe-Primont and Lowe measures, it is possible to rule out technological change.
  The package also allows to prohibit negative technological change.
  All the estimations are based on the nonparametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and several 
  assumptions regarding returns to scale are available (i.e. CRS, VRS, NIRS, NDRS).
  The package allows parallel computing by default, depending on the user's computer configuration.
