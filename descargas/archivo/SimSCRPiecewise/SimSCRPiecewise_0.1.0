        Covariates and Piecewise Exponential Baseline Hazards'

Description: Contains two functions for simulating survival data from piecewise exponential hazards with a proportional hazards adjustment for covariates. The first function SimUNIVPiecewise simulates univariate survival data based on a piecewise exponential hazard, covariate matrix and true regression vector. The second function SimSCRPiecewise semi-competing risks data based on three piecewise exponential hazards, three true regression vectors and three matrices of patient covariates (which can be different or the same). This simulates from the Semi-Markov model of Lee et al (2015) given patient covariates, regression parameters, patient frailties and baseline hazard functions.
