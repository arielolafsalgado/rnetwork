Description: Convenient functions for ensemble forecasts in R combining
    approaches from the 'forecast' package. Forecasts generated from auto.arima(),
    ets(), nnetar(), stlm(), and tbats() can be combined with equal weights or
    weights based on in-sample errors. Future methods such as cross validation are
    planned.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.1), forecast (>= 7.1)
