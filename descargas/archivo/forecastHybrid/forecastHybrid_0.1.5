Description: Convenient functions for ensemble forecasts in R combining
    approaches from the 'forecast' package. Forecasts generated from auto.arima(), ets(),
    nnetar(), stlm(), and tbats() can be combined with equal weights or weights based on
    in-sample errors. Future methods such as cross validation are planned.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.1), forecast (>= 7.1), fpp (>= 0.5)
