Description: Convenient functions for ensemble forecasts in R combining
    approaches from the 'forecast' package. Forecasts generated from auto.arima(), ets(),
    thetam(), nnetar(), stlm(), and tbats() can be combined with equal weights, weights
    based on in-sample errors (introduced by Bates & Granger (1969) <doi:10.1057/jors.1969.103>), or cross-validated weights. Cross
    validation for time series data with user-supplied models and forecasting
    functions is also supported to evaluate model accuracy.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.1), forecast (>= 8.1),
Imports: doParallel (>= 1.0.10), foreach (>= 1.4.3), ggplot2 (>=
        2.2.0), zoo (>= 1.7)
