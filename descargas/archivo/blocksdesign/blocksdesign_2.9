Description: Constructs D-optimal or near D-optimal nested and crossed 
  block designs for unstructured or general factorial treatment designs. 
  Where a structured treatment design is required, a D-optimal or near 
  D-optimal treatment design is found based on a suitable model
  matrix design formula. The required block design is then found for the 
  required treatment design based on a defined set of block factors. 
  The block factors are added in sequence and each added block factor
  is optimized conditional on all previously added block factors.
  The block design can have repeated nesting down to any required 
  depth of nesting with either a simple set of nested blocks or a
  crossed blocks design at each level of nesting. If a crossed
  blocks design has more than a single plot in each crossed blocks
  intersection, the determinant of a weighted combination of the 
  information matrix for additive crossed blocks effects and the
  information matrix for multiplicative crossed blocks effects
  is used as the design criterion. Outputs include a table
  showing the allocation of treatments to blocks and tables showing
  the achieved D-efficiency factors for each block and treatment design.
