Description: Constructs randomized nested or crossed block designs for 
    unstructured treatment sets or for factorial treatments sets. Where the 
    treatments are factorial, the treatments model can be defined by using the
    model formulation defined in the model.matrix {stats} base package. Blocks
    are nested hierarchically in successive blocks strata and the blocks
    model in any particular stratum can comprise either a simple nested blocks 
    design or a crossed row-and-column design. Block sizes in any one stratum 
    are either all equal or differ, at most, by one plot. The design outputs 
    include a data frame showing the allocation of treatments to blocks, a table
    showing block levels, the achieved D-efficiency, the achieved A-efficiency
    (unstructured treatments only) and A-efficiency upper bounds, where available,
    for each stratum in the design. For designs with simple unstructured treatments,
    a plan layout showing the allocation of treatments to blocks or to rows and
    columns in the bottom stratum of the design is also given.
