Description: Constructs randomized nested row-and-column type block designs
    with arbitrary depth of nesting for arbitrary factorial or fractional 
    factorial treatment designs. The treatment model can be defined
    by a models.matrix formula which allows any feasible 
    combination of quantitative or qualitative model terms.
    Any feasible design size can be defined and, where necessary, 
    a D-optimal swapping routine will find the best fraction for the required 
    design size. Blocks are nested hierarchically in successive strata and the
    blocks model in any particular stratum will comprise either a simple nested blocks 
    design or a crossed row-and-column blocks design. Block sizes in any one stratum 
    are either all equal or differ, at most, by one plot. The design outputs 
    include a data frame showing the allocation of treatments to blocks, a table
    showing block levels, the fractional design efficiency, 
    the achieved D-efficiency, the achieved A-efficiency
    (unstructured treatments only) and A-efficiency upper bounds, where available,
    for each stratum in the design. For designs with simple unstructured treatments,
    a plan layout showing the allocation of treatments to blocks or to rows and
    columns in the bottom stratum of the design is also given.
