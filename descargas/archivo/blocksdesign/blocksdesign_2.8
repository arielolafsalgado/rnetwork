Description: The 'blocksdesign' package constructs nested block and 
    D-optimal factorial designs for any unstructured or factorial
    treatment model of any size. The nested block designs can have repeated 
    nesting down to any required depth of nesting with either a simple set 
    of nested blocks or a crossed row-and-column blocks design at each level
    of nesting. The block design at each level of nesting is optimized for
    D-efficiency within the blocks of each preceding set of 
    blocks. Outputs include a table showing the allocation of 
    treatments to blocks, a plan layout showing the allocation of treatments
    within blocks (unstructured treatment designs only) the achieved
    D-efficiency factors for the block and treatment design 
    (factorial treatment designs only) and, where feasible,
    an A-efficiency factor and A-efficiency upper bound for the block design 
    (unstructured treatment designs only).
