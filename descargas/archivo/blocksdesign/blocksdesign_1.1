Description: Nested block designs for unstructured treatment sets where blocks
    can be repeatedly nested and treatments can have different levels of
    replication. Blocks strata are optimized hierarchically with each set of
    nested blocks optimized within the levels of the preceding set. Block sizes
    are equal if the number of blocks exactly divides the number of plots,
    otherwise they differ by at most one plot. The design output is a data
    table giving a randomised allocation of treatments to blocks together with
    a plan table showing treatments in blocks and a set of blocks-by-treatments
    incidence matrices, one for each blocks stratum.
