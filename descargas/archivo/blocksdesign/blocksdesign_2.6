Description: The 'blocksdesign' package constructs nested block and
    D-optimal factorial designs for any unstructured or factorial
    treatment model of any size. The nested block designs can have
    repeated nesting down to any required depth of nesting with
    either a simple set of nested blocks or a crossed
    row-and-column blocks design at each level of nesting.
    The block design at each level of nesting is optimized for
    D-efficiency within the blocks of each preceding set of blocks.
    The block sizes in any particular block classification are
    always as nearly equal as possible and never differ by more
    than a single plot. Outputs include a table showing the
    allocation of treatments to blocks, a plan layout showing
    the allocation of treatments within blocks (unstructured
    treatment designs only) the achieved D-efficiency and
    A-efficiency factors for the block and treatment design
    (factorial treatment designs only) and,
    where feasible, an A-efficiency upper bound for
    the block design (unstructured treatment designs only).
