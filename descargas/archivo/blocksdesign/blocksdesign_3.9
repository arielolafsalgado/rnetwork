Description: Constructs D-optimal or near D-optimal nested and crossed 
  block designs for unstructured or general factorial treatment designs. 
  The treatment design, if required, is found from a model
  matrix design formula and can be added sequentially, if required.
  The block design is found from a defined
  set of block factors and is conditional on the defined treatment design.   
  The block factors are added in sequence and each added block factor
  is optimized conditional on all previously added block factors.
  The block design can have repeated nesting down to any required 
  depth of nesting with either simple nested blocks or
  crossed blocks at each level of nesting. Outputs include a table
  showing the allocation of treatments to blocks and tables showing
  the achieved D-efficiency factors for each block and treatment design.
