Description: Functions for computing fit indices for 
    evaluating the path component of latent variable structural equation models. 
    Available fit indices include RMSEA-P and NSCI-P originally presented and evaluated 
    by Williams and O'Boyle (2011) <doi:10.1177/1094428110391472> and demonstrated by 
    O'Boyle and Williams (2011) <doi:10.1037/a0020539> and Williams, O'Boyle, & Yu (2020) 
    <doi:10.1177/1094428117736137>. Also included are fit indices described by 
    Hancock and Mueller (2011) <doi:10.1177/0013164410384856>.
