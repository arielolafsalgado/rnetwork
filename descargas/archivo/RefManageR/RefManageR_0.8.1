Description: RefManageR provides tools for importing and working with
    bibliographic references.  It greatly enhances the bibentry class by
    providing a class BibEntry which stores BibTeX and BibLaTeX references,
    supports UTF-8 encoding, and can be easily searched by any field, by date
    ranges, and by various formats for name lists (author by last names,
    translator by full names, etc.). Entries can be updated, combined, sorted,
    printed in a number of styles, and exported. BibTeX and BibLaTeX .bib files
    can be read into R and converted to BibEntry objects.  Interfaces to NCBI's
    Entrez, CrossRef, and Zotero are provided for importing references and
    references can be created from locally stored PDFs using Poppler.  Includes
    functions for citing and generating a bibliography with hyperlinks for
    documents prepared with RMarkdown or RHTML.
