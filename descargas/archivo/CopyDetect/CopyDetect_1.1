Description: CopyDetect contains several IRT and non-IRT based statistical indices proposed in the literature for detecting answer copying on multiple-choice examinations. CopyDetect includes the indices that have been shown as effective and reliable based on the simulation studies. CopyDetect provides results for the Omega index (Wollack, 1996), Generalized Binomial Test (van der Linden & Sotaridona, 2006), K index (Holland, 1996), K1 and K2 indices (Sotaridona & Meijer, 2002), and S1 and S2 indices (Sotaridona & Meijer, 2003).
