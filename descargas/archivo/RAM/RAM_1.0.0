Description: This package provides a series of functions to make amplicon-based metagenomic analysis more accessible, and publication-quality plots simple. Amplicon-based (or targeted) metagenomics amplifies and sequences selected DNA regions of environmental samples, but not the entire pool of genetic material, which is referred to as shotgun metagenomics. The amplicon-metagenomics mainly aims at characterizing broad microbiota biodiversity in different environments.
