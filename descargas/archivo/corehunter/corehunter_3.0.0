Description: Interface to the Core Hunter software for core subset selection.
    Cores can be constructed based on genetic marker data, phenotypic traits,
    a precomputed distance matrix, or any combination of these. Various measures
    are included such as Modified Rogers' distance and Shannon's diversity index
    (for genotypes) and Gower's distance (for phenotypes). Core Hunter can also
    optimize a weighted combination of multiple measures, to bring the different
    perspectives closer together.
