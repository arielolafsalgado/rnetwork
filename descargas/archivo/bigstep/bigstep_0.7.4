Description: Selecting linear and generalized linear models for large data sets
    using modified stepwise procedure and modern selection criteria (like
    modifications of Bayesian Information Criterion). Selection can be
    performed on data which exceed RAM capacity. Special selection strategy is
    available, faster than classical stepwise procedure.
