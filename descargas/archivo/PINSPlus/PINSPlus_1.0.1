Description: Provides a robust approach for omics data integration and disease subtyping. It is an improved implementation of PINS - Perturbation clustering for data INtegration and disease Subtyping (Nguyen T, Tagett R, Diaz D, Draghici S, Genome Research, 2017, <doi:10.1101/gr.215129.116>). 'PINSPlus' supports both single and multiple data types. The software automatically determines the optimal number of clusters and then partitions the samples in a way such that the results are robust to noise and data perturbation. 'PINSPlus' is fast and it supports parallel computing on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
