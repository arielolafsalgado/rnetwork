Description: Provides a robust approach for omics data integration and disease subtyping. 'PINSPlus' supports both single and multiple data types. The software automatically determines the optimal number of clusters and then partitions the samples in a way such that the results are robust to noise and data perturbation. 'PINSPlus' is fast and it supports parallel computing on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
