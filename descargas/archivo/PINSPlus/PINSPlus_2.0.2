Description: Provides a robust approach for omics data integration and disease subtyping.
  PINSPlus is fast and supports the analysis of large datasets with hundreds of thousands of
  samples and features. The software automatically determines the optimal number
  of clusters and then partitions the samples in a way such that the results are robust against
  noise and data perturbation.
