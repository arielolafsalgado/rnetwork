Description: Clustering algorithm for determining the number of clusters and location of each sample in the clusters. Perturbation clustering for data INtegration and disease Subtyping (PINS - Nguyen T, Tagett R, Diaz D, Draghici S (2017) <doi:10.1101/gr.215129.116>) is a novel approach for integration of data and classification of diseases into various subtypes. PINS supports both single and multiple data types. 'PINSPlus' is designed to be user-friendly and primarily makes use of two main functions. 'PINSPlus' fasten PINS algorithm by supporting parallel processing and using efficient stopping criteria.
