Title: Robust Model-Based Clustering
Description: Performs robust cluster analysis allowing for outliers and noise that cannot be fitted by any cluster. The data are modelled by a mixture of Gaussian distributions and a noise component, which is an improper uniform  distribution covering the whole Euclidean space. Parameters are estimated by  (pseudo) maximum likelihood. This is fitted by a EM-type algorithm. See Coretto and Hennig (2016) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2015.1100996>, and Coretto and Hennig (2017) <arXiv:1309.6895>.
