Description: The purpose of 'Relexon' is to allow R users to pull data from the UK's Balancing Mechanism Reporting Service, otherwise known as 'Elexon', using the 'BMRS' API <https://www.bmreports.com/bmrs/?q=help/about-us>. This can range from different types of electricity generation, how much electricity is used in a 5-minute period, imports, temperatures and forecasts. Users will require an 'Elexon' key, which are freely available by registering at <https://www.elexonportal.co.uk>.
