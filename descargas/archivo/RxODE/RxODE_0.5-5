Description: Facilities for running simulations from ordinary 
   differential equation (ODE) models, such as pharmacometrics and other 
   compartmental models.  A compilation manager translates the ODE model 
   into C, compiles it, and dynamically loads the object code into R for 
   improved computational efficiency.  An event table object facilitates 
   the specification of complex dosing regimens (optional) and sampling 
   schedules.  NB: The use of this package requires both C and 
   Fortran compilers, for details on their use with R please see 
   Section 6.3, Appendix A, and Appendix D in the "R Administration and 
   Installation" manual.
