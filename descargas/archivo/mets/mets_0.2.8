Description: Implementation of various statistical models for multivariate
    event history data. Including multivariate cumulative incidence models, and
    bivariate random effects probit models (Liability models). Also contains
    two-stage binomial modelling that can do pairwise odds-ratio dependence
    modelling based marginal logistic regression models. This is an alternative
    to the alternating logistic regression approach (ALR).
