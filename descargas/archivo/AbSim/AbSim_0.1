Description: Simulation methods for the evolution of antibody repertoires. The heavy chain variable region of both human and C57BL/6 mice can be simulated in a time-dependent fashion. Both single lineages using one set of V-, D-, and J-genes or full repertoires can be simulated. The algorithm begins with an initial VDJ recombination event, starting the first phylogenetic tree. Upon completion, the main loop of the algorithm begins, with each iteration representing one simulated time step. Various mutation events are possible at each time step, contributing to a diverse final repertoire.
