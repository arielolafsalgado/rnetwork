Description: This is a fast and flexible implementation of the Kalman
        filter, which can deal with NAs. It is entirely written in C
        and relies fully on linear algebra subroutines contained in
        BLAS and LAPACK. Due to the speed of the filter, the fitting of
        high-dimensional linear state space models to large datasets
        becomes possible. This package also contains a plot function
        for the visualization of the state vector and graphical
        diagnostics of the residuals.
