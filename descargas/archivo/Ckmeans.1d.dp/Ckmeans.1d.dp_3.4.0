Version: 3.4.0
Author: Joe Song and Haizhou Wang
Maintainer: Joe Song <joemsong@cs.nmsu.edu>
Description: A dynamic programming algorithm for optimal one-dimensional k-means clustering. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squares of within-cluster distances. As an alternative to the standard heuristic k-means algorithm, this algorithm guarantees optimality and repeatability.
