Description: Fast, optimal, and reproducible weighted univariate
 clustering by dynamic programming. Four types of problem including
 univariate k-means, k-median, k-segments, and multi-channel
 weighted k-means are solved with guaranteed optimality and
 reproducibility. The core algorithm minimizes the sum of (weighted)
 within-cluster distances using respective metrics. Its advantage
 over heuristic clustering in efficiency and accuracy is pronounced
 at a large number of clusters k. Weighted k-means can also process
 time series to perform peak calling. Multi-channel weighted k-means
 groups multiple univariate signals into k clusters. An auxiliary
 function generates histograms that are adaptive to patterns in data.
 This package provides a powerful set of tools for univariate data
 analysis with guaranteed optimality, efficiency, and reproducibility.
