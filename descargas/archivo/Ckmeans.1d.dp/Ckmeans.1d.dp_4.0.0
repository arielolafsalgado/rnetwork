Description: A fast dynamic programming algorithm for optimal univariate
 clustering. Minimizing the sum of squares of within-cluster distances, the
 algorithm guarantees optimality and reproducibility. Its advantage over
 heuristic clustering algorithms in efficiency and accuracy is increasingly
 pronounced as the number of clusters k increases. With optional weights, the
 algorithm can also optimally segment time series and perform peak calling. An
 auxiliary function generates histograms that are adaptive to patterns in data.
 This package provides a powerful alternative to heuristic methods for
 univariate data analysis.
