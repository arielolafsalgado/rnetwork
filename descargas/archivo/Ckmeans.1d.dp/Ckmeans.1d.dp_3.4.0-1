Title: Optimal k-Means Clustering for One-Dimensional Data
Version: 3.4.0-1
Author: Joe Song and Haizhou Wang
Maintainer: Joe Song <joemsong@cs.nmsu.edu>
Description: A dynamic programming algorithm for optimal one-dimensional k-means clustering. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squares of within-cluster distances. As an alternative to heuristic k-means algorithms, this method guarantees optimality and reproducibility. Its advantage in efficiency and accuracy over k-means is increasingly pronounced as the number of clusters k increases.
