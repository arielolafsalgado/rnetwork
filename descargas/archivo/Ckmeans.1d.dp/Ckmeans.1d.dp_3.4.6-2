Description: A dynamic programming algorithm for optimal one-dimensional
 k-means clustering. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squares of
 within-cluster distances. As an alternative to heuristic k-means algorithms,
 this method guarantees optimality and reproducibility. Its advantage in
 efficiency and accuracy over k-means is increasingly pronounced as the
 number of clusters k increases.
