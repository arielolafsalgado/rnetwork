Description: Variables are the fundamental parts of each programming language but handling them might be frustrating for programmers from time to time. This package contains some functions to help user (especially data explorers) to make more sense of their variables and take the most out of variables as well as their hardware. These functions are written, collected and crafted over some years of experience in statistical data analysis and for each of them there was a need. Functions in this package are suppose to be efficient and easy to use, hence they will be frequently updated to make them more convenient.
