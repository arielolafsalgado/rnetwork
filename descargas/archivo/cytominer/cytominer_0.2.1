Description: Typical morphological profiling datasets have millions of cells
    and hundreds of features per cell. When working with this data, you must
    clean the data, normalize the features to make them comparable across
    experiments, transform the features, select features based on their
    quality, and aggregate the single-cell data, if needed. 'cytominer' makes
    these steps fast and easy. Methods used in practice in the field are
    discussed in Caicedo (2017) <doi:10.1038/nmeth.4397>. An overview of the
    field is presented in Caicedo (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.copbio.2016.04.003>.
