Title: Multi-State Markov and Hidden Markov Models in Continuous Time
Author: Christopher Jackson <chris.jackson@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>
Maintainer: Christopher Jackson <chris.jackson@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>
Description: Functions for fitting continuous-time Markov and hidden
 Markov multi-state models to longitudinal data.  Designed for
 processes observed at arbitrary times in continuous time (panel data)
 but some other observation schemes are supported. Both Markov
 transition rates and the hidden Markov output process can be modelled
 in terms of covariates, which may be constant or piecewise-constant
 in time.
