Title: Multi-state Markov and hidden Markov models in continuous time
Author: Christopher Jackson <chris.jackson@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>
Maintainer: Christopher Jackson <chris.jackson@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>
Description: Functions for fitting general continuous-time Markov and
 hidden Markov multi-state models to longitudinal data.  A variety of
 observation schemes are supported, including processes observed at
 arbitrary times (panel data), continuously-observed processes, and
 censored states. Both Markov transition rates and the hidden Markov
 output process can be modelled in terms of covariates, which may be
 constant or piecewise-constant in time.
