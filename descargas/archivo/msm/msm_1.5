Title: Multi-state Markov and Hidden Markov Models in Continuous Time
Author: Christopher Jackson <chris.jackson@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>
Maintainer: Christopher Jackson <chris.jackson@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>
Description: Continuous-time Markov and hidden Markov multi-state
 models for longitudinal data.  Designed for processes observed at
 arbitrary times in continuous time (panel data) but some other
 observation schemes are supported. Both Markov transition rates and
 the hidden Markov output process can be modelled in terms of
 covariates, which may be constant or piecewise-constant in time.
