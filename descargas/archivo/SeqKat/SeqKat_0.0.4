Description: Kataegis is a localized hypermutation occurring when a region is enriched in somatic SNVs. Kataegis can result from multiple cytosine deaminations catalyzed by the AID/APOBEC family of proteins. This package contains functions to detect kataegis from SNVs in BED format. SeqKat reports two scores per kataegic event, a hypermutation score and an APOBEC mediated kataegic score. Upon publication of the paper describing the methods used in this package, a reference will be added here.
