Description: Defines classes and methods that can be used
  to implement genetic algorithms for feature selection.  The idea is
  that we want to select a fixed number of features to combine into a
  linear classifier that can predict a binary outcome, and can use a
  genetic algorithm heuristically to select an optimal set of features.
