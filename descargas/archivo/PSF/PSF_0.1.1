Description: Various functions in Pattern Sequence Based Forecasting (PSF) takes
    time series data as input and assist to forecast the future value with
    the help of Algorithm PSF. This algorithm forecasts the behavior of time series
    based on similarity of pattern sequences. Initially, clustering is done with the
    labeling of samples from database. The labels associated with samples are then
    used for forecasting the future behaviour of time series data. The further
    technical details and references regarding PSF are discussed in Vignette.
