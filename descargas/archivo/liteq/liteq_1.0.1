Title: Lightweight Portable Message Queue Using 'SQLite'
Version: 1.0.1
Author: G치bor Cs치rdi
Maintainer: G치bor Cs치rdi <csardi.gabor@gmail.com>
Description: Temporary and permanent message queues for R. Built on top of
    'SQLite' databases. 'SQLite' provides locking, and makes it possible
    to detect crashed consumers. Crashed jobs can be automatically marked
    as "failed", or put in the queue again, potentially a limited number of times.
