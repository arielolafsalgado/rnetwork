Description: A tool to streamline the analysis of animal acoustic signal structure. The package offers functions for downloading avian vocalizations from the open-access online repository Xeno-Canto, displaying the geographic extent of the recordings, manipulating sound files, detecting acoustic signals or importing detected signals from other software, assessing performance of methods that measure acoustic similarity, conducting cross-correlations, dynamic time warping, measuring acoustic parameters and analysing interactive vocal signals, among others. Most functions working iteratively allow parallelization to improve computational efficiency.
