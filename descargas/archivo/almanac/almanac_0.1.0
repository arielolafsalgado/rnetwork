Description: Provides tools for defining recurrence rules and
    recurrence bundles. Recurrence rules are a programmatic way to define
    a recurring event, like the first Monday of December. Multiple
    recurrence rules can be combined into larger recurrence bundles.
    Together, these provide a system for adjusting and generating
    sequences of dates while simultaneously skipping over dates in a
    recurrence bundle's event set.
