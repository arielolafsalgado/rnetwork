Title: Nonparametric Estimation of the Trend and Its Derivatives in TS
Version: 1.0.0
Description: The nonparametric trend and its derivatives in equidistant time 
    series (TS) with short-memory stationary errors can be estimated. The 
    estimation is conducted via local polynomial regression using an 
    automatically selected bandwidth obtained by a built-in iterative plug-in 
    algorithm or a bandwidth fixed by the user. A Nadaraya-Watson kernel 
    smoother is also built-in as a comparison.
    The methods of the package are described in
    Feng, Y., and Gries, T., (2017) <http://groups.uni-paderborn.de/wp-wiwi/RePEc/pdf/ciepap/WP102.pdf>. 
    A current version of the paper that is also referred to in the 
    documentation of the functions is prepared for publication.
