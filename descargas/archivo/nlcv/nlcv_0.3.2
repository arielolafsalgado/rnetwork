Description: Nested loop cross validation for classification purposes for misclassification error rate estimation.
  The package supports several methodologies for feature selection: random forest, Student t-test, limma, 
  and provides an interface to the following classification methods in the 'MLInterfaces' package: linear, 
  quadratic discriminant analyses, random forest, bagging, prediction analysis for microarray, generalized 
  linear model, support vector machine (svm and ksvm). Visualizations to assess the quality of
  the classifier are included: plot of the ranks of the features, scores plot for a specific 
  classification algorithm and number of features, misclassification rate 
  for the different number of features and classification algorithms tested and ROC plot.
