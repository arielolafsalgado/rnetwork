Title: Summarise a Distribution Through Coloured Intervals
Description: Implements the functionality of the 'fanplot' package as 'geoms' 
  for 'ggplot2'. Designed for summarising MCMC samples from a posterior 
  distribution, where a visualisation is desired for several values of a 
  continuous covariate. Increasing posterior intervals of the sampled quantity 
  are mapped to a continuous colour scale.
