Description: Using V-algorithm and Newton-Raphson method to obtain multiple-objective optimal design for estimating the shape of dose-response, the ED50 (the dose producing an effect midway between the expected responses at the extreme doses) and the MED (the minimum effective dose level) for the 2,3,4-parameter logistic models and for evaluating its efficiencies for the three objectives.
