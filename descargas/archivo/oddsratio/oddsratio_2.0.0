Description: Simplified odds ratio calculation of GAM(M)s &
    GLM(M)s.  Provides structured output (data frame) of all predictors
    and their corresponding odds ratios and confident intervals for
    further analyses.  It helps to avoid false references of predictors
    and increments by specifying these parameters in a list instead of
    using 'exp(coef(model))' (standard approach of odds ratio calculation
    for GLMs) which just returns a plain numeric output.  For GAM(M)s,
    odds ratio calculation is highly simplified with this package since it
    takes care of the multiple 'predict()' calls of the chosen predictor
    while holding other predictors constant.  Also, this package allows
    odds ratio calculation of percentage steps across the whole predictor
    distribution range for GAM(M)s.  In both cases, confident intervals
    are returned additionally.  Calculated odds ratio of GAM(M)s can be
    inserted into the smooth function plot.
