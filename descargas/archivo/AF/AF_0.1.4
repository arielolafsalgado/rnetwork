Description: Estimates the attributable fraction in different sampling designs
    adjusted for measured confounders using logistic regression (cross-sectional
    and case-control designs), conditional logistic regression (matched case-control
    design), Cox proportional hazard regression (cohort design with time-to-
    event outcome) and gamma-frailty model with a Weibull baseline hazard. The variance of the estimator is obtained by combining the delta
    method with the the sandwich formula. Dahlqwist et al.(2016) <doi:10.1007/s10654-016-0137-7>.
