Title: Wrapper for FFTW3: Includes 1-D, Univariate and Multivariate,
        and 2-D Transform

Depends: R (>= 2.15.2)
SystemRequirements: fftw3 (>= 3.1.2)
Suggests: fftw
Description: Provides a wrapper for several FFTW functions. This package provides access to the two-dimensional FFT, the multivariate FFT, and the one-dimensional real to complex FFT using FFTW3. The package includes the functions fftw and mvfftw which are designed to mimic the functionality of the R functions fft and mvfft. The FFT functions have a parameter that allows them to not return the redundant complex conjugate when the input is real data.
