Title: Utility Functions to Execute Standard Extract/Transform/Load
        Operations (using Package 'ff') on Large Data
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Jan Wijffels
Description: Provides functions to facilitate the use of the 'ff' package
    in interaction with big data in 'SQL' databases (e.g. in 'Oracle', 'MySQL',
    'PostgreSQL', 'Hive') by allowing easy importing directly into 'ffdf' objects
    using 'DBI', 'RODBC' and 'RJDBC'. Also contains some basic utility functions to
    do fast left outer join merging based on 'match', factorisation of data and a
    basic function for re-coding vectors.
