Description: We provide the framework to analyze multiresolution partitions (e.g. country, provinces, subdistrict) where each individual data point belongs to only one partition in each layer (e.g. i belongs to subdistrict A, province P, and country Q).   We assume that a partition in a higher layer subsumes lower-layer partitions (e.g. a nation is at the 1st layer subsumes all provinces at the 2nd layer). Given N individuals that have a pair of real values (x,y) that generated from  independent variable X and dependent variable Y. Each individual i belongs to one partition per layer. Our goal is to find which partitions at which highest level that all individuals  in the these partitions share the same linear model Y=f(X) where f is a linear function. The framework deploys the Minimum Description Length principle (MDL) to infer solutions.
