Title: Weighted Win Loss Statistics and their Variances
Description: Calculate the (weighted) win loss statistics including the win ratio, win difference and win product 
 and their variances, with which the p-values are also calculated. The variance estimation is based on 
 Luo et al. (2015) <doi:10.1111/biom.12225> and Luo et al. (2017) <doi:10.1002/sim.7284>. This package also calculates general win loss statistics with 
 user-specified win loss function with variance estimation based on 
 Bebu and Lachin (2016) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxv032>.
