Description: Estimates and plots effect estimates from models with all possible 
    combinations of a list of variables. It can be used for assessing treatment 
    effects in clinical trials or risk factors in bio-medical and epidemiological 
    research. Like Stata command 'confall' (Wang Z (2007) <doi:10.1177/1536867X0700700203> ), 
    'allestimates' calculates and stores all effect estimates, and plots them against p values or 
    Akaike information criterion (AIC) values. It currently has functions for linear 
    regression: all_lm(), logistic and Poisson regression: all_glm() and all_speedglm(), 
    and Cox proportional hazards regression: all_cox().
