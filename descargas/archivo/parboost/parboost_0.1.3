Package: parboost
Title: Distributed Model-Based Boosting
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 2014-03-02
Description: Distributed gradient boosting based on the mboost package. The
    parboost package is designed to scale up component-wise functional
    gradient boosting in a distributed memory environment by splitting the
    observations into disjoint subsets, or alternatively using bootstrap
    samples (bagging). Each cluster node then fits a boosting model to its
    subset of the data. These boosting models are combined in an ensemble,
    either with equal weights, or by fitting a (penalized) regression
    model on the predictions of the individual models on the complete
    data.
