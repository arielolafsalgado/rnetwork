Description: Provides an extensible formula system to quickly and easily create
    production quality tables. The steps of the process are formula parser,
    statistical content generation from data, to rendering. Each step of the process
    is separate and user definable thus creating a set of building blocks for
    highly extensible table generation. A user is not limited by any of the 
    choices of the package creator other than the formula grammar. For example,
    one could chose to add a different S3 rendering function and output a format
    not provided in the default package. Or possibly one would rather have Gini
    coefficients for their statistical content. Routines to achieve New England
    Journal of Medicine style, Lancet style and Hmisc::summaryM() statistics are
    provided. The package contains rendering for HTML5, Rmarkdown and an indexing
    format for use in tracing and tracking are provided.
