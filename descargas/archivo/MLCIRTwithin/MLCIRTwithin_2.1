Title: Latent Class Item Response Theory (LC-IRT) Models under
        Within-Item Multidimensionality
Version: 2.1

Description: Framework for the Item Response Theory analysis of dichotomous and ordinal polytomous outcomes under the assumption of within-item multidimensionality and discreteness of the latent traits. The fitting algorithms allow for missing responses and for different item parametrizations and are based on the Expectation-Maximization paradigm. Individual covariates affecting the class weights may be included in the new version together with possibility of constraints on all model parameters.
