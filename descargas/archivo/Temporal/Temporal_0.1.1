Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: person("Zachary", "McCaw", email = "zmccaw@g.harvard.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Performs likelihood-based estimation and inference on time to event data, possibly subject to non-informative right censoring. fitParaSurv() provides maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters and distributional characteristics. compParaSurv() compares the mean and median survival experiences of two treatment arms. Candidate distributions currently include the exponential, gamma, generalized gamma, log-logistic, log-normal, and Weibull.
