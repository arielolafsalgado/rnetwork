Description: Given independent and identically distributed observations
        X(1), ..., X(n) from a Generalized Pareto distribution with
        shape parameter gamma in [-1,0], this package offers several
        estimates to compute estimates of gamma. The estimates are
        based on the principle of replacing the order statistics by
        quantiles of a distribution function based on a log--concave
        density function. This procedure is justified by the fact that
        the GPD density is log--concave for gamma in [-1,0].
