Description: The bioinformatic evaluation of gene co-expression often begins with
    correlation-based analyses. However, this approach lacks statistical validity
    when applied to relative count data. This includes, for example, biological data
    produced by high-throughput RNA-sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP),
    ChIP-sequencing, Methyl-Capture sequencing, and other techniques. Two metrics of
    proportionality, phi [Lovell et al (2015) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004075>]
    and rho [Erb and Notredame (2016) <DOI:10.1007/s12064-015-0220-8>], both derived
    from compositional data analysis, a branch of math dealing specifically with
    relative data, represent novel alternatives to correlation. This package
    introduces a programmatic framework for calculating feature dependence through
    proportionality, as discussed in the cited publications.
