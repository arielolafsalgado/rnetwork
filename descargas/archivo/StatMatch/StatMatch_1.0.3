Description: The package StatMatch provides some R functions to perform
        statistical matching, i.e. the integration of two data sources
        referred to the same target population which share a number of
        common variables. Some functions can also be used to impute
        missing values in data sets through hot deck imputation
        methods. Methods to perform statistical matching when dealing
        with data from complex sample surveys are available too.
