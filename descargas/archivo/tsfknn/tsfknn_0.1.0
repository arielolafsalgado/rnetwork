Description: Allows to forecast time series using nearest neighbors regression
    Francisco Martinez, Maria P. Frias, Maria D. Perez-Godoy and Antonio J.
    Rivera (2017) <doi:10.1007/s10462-017-9593-z>. When the forecasting horizon
    multi-step ahead forecasting strategies can be used. The model built is 
    is higher than 1, two autoregressive, that is, it is only based on the 
    observations of the time series. The nearest neighbors used in a 
    prediction can be consulted and plotted.
