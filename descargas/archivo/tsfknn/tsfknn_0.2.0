Description: Allows to forecast time series using nearest neighbors regression
    Francisco Martinez, Maria P. Frias, Maria D. Perez-Godoy and Antonio J.
    Rivera (2017) <doi:10.1007/s10462-017-9593-z>. When the forecasting horizon
    is higher than 1, two multi-step ahead forecasting strategies can be used.
    The model built is autoregressive, that is, it is only based on the 
    observations of the time series. The nearest neighbors used in a prediction
    can be consulted and plotted.
