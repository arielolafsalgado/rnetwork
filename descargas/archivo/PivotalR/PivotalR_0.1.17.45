Description: R interface of Pivotal Data Fabrics running on PostgreSQL
        or Pivotal (Greenplum and HAWQ) database with parallel and
        distributed computation ability for big data analytics.
        PivotalR is a package that enables users of R to interact with
        the Pivotal (Greenplum) Database as well as Pivotal HD/HAWQ for
        Big Data analytics. It does so by providing an interface to the
        operations on tables/views in the database. These operations
        are almost the same as those of data.frame. Thus the users of R
        do not need to learn SQL when they operate on the objects in
        the database. It also provides a wrapper for MADlib, which is
        an open-source library for parallel and scalable in-database
        analytics.
