Description: This is a collection of tools that the author (Jacob) has written
  for the purpose of more efficiently understanding and sharing the results of
  (primarily) regression analyses. There are a number of functions focused
  specifically on the interpretation and presentation of interactions in linear
  models. Just about everything supports models from the survey package.
