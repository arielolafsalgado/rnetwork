Description: Contains data analysis functions to estimate above-ground biomass and its uncertainty in tropical forests. BIOMASS functions allow to (1) retrieve and to correct taxonomy, (2) estimate wood density and its uncertainty, (3) construct height-diameter models, (4) estimate the above-ground biomass at the stand level with associated uncertainty.
