Description: Contains functions to estimate aboveground biomass/carbon and its uncertainty in tropical forests. These functions allow to (1) retrieve and to correct taxonomy, (2) estimate wood density and its uncertainty, (3) construct height-diameter models, (4) estimate the above-ground biomass/carbon at the stand level with associated uncertainty.
