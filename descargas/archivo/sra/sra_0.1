Description: This package (sra) provides a set of tools to analyse
        artificial-selection response datasets. The data typically
        feature for several generations the average value of a trait in
        a population, the variance of the trait, the population size
        and the average value of the parents that were chosen to breed.
        Sra implements two families of models aiming at describing the
        dynamics of the genetic architecture of the trait during the
        selection response. The first family relies on purely
        descriptive (phenomenological) models, based on an
        autoregressive framework. The second family provides different
        mechanistic models, accounting e.g. for inbreeding, mutations,
        genetic and environmental canalization, or epistasis. The
        parameters underlying the dynamics of the time series are
        estimated by maximum likelihood. The sra package thus provides
        (i) a wrapper for the R functions mle() and optim() aiming at
        fitting in a convenient way a predetermined set of models, and
        (ii) some functions to plot and analyze the output of the
        models.
