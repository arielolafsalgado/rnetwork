Description: Human names are complicated and nonstandard things. Humaniformat, which is based on Anthony Ettinger's 'humanparser'
             project (https://github.com/chovy/humanparser) provides functions for parsing human names,
             making a best-guess attempt to distinguish sub-components such as prefixes, suffixes, middle names and salutations.
