        Surname and Geolocation

Maintainer: Kabir Khanna <kkhanna@princeton.edu>
Description: This open-source software package enables researchers to predict
    individual ethnicity using his/her surname, geolocation, and other attributes
    such as gender and age. The method utilizes the Bayes' rule to compute the
    posterior probability of each racial category for any given individual voter.
    The package implements methods described in Imai and Khanna (2016) "Improving
    Ecological Inference by Predicting Individual Ethnicity from Voter Registration
    Records" <DOI:10.1093/pan/mpw001>.
