Description: A collection of tools for importing the professional baseball data
    available from http://www.retrosheet.org. In particular, the event (play-by-play)
    files can be especially difficult to parse.  This package does the parsing
    on those files, returning the requested event as a structured R object.
    It will also retrieve the game-log, roster, and schedule files if requested.
