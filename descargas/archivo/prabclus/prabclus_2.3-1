Description: Distance-based parametric bootstrap tests for clustering with 
  spatial neighborhood information. Some distance measures, 
  Clustering of presence-absence, abundance and multilocus genetical data 
  for species delimitation, nearest neighbor 
  based noise detection. Genetic distances between communities.
  Tests whether various distance-based regressions
  are equal. Try package?prabclus for on overview.
