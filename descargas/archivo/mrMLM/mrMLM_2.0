Description: Conduct multi-locus GWAS and multi-locus QTL mapping under the framework of random-SNP-effect mixed linear model (mrMLM). First, each position (or marker) on the genome is scanned by mrMLM algorithm. Bonferroni correction is replaced by a less stringent selection criterion for significant test. Then, all the markers (or QTL) that are potentially associated with the trait are included in a multi-locus model, their effects are estimated by empirical Bayes and true QTN or QTL are identified by likelihood ratio test.
