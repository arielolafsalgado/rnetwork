Description: Conduct multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model analysis for genome-wide association study. First, each marker is scanned using random-SNP-effect mixed linear model method. Then, all the markers selected from the first step are included in the multi-locus model and their effects are estimated by an EM empirical Bayes method. No multiple test correction is needed.
