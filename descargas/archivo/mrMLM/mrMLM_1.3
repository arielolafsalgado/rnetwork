Description: Conduct multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model analysis for genome-wide association study and linkage analysis. First, each position (or marker) on the genome is scanned using random-SNP-effect mixed linear model method. Then, all the markers (or putative QTL) selected from the first step are included in the multi-locus model and their effects are estimated by an EM empirical Bayes method. Bonferroni correction is replaced by a less stringent selection criterion for significance test.
