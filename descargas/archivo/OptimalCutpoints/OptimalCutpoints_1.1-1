Description: This package enables users to compute one or more optimal cutpoints for diagnostic tests or continuous markers. Various approaches for selecting optimal cutoffs have been implemented, including methods based on cost-benefit analysis and diagnostic test accuracy measures (Sensitivity/Specificity, Predictive Values and Diagnostic Likelihood Ratios). Numerical and graphical output for all methods is easily obtained.
