Package: timeseriesdb
Type: Package
Version: 0.2.1
Title: Manage Time Series with R and PostgreSQL
Description: Store and organize a large amount of low frequency time series data. 
    The package was designed to manage a large catalog of official statistics which are
    typically published on monthly, quarterly or yearly basis. Thus timeseriesdb is
    optimized to handle a large number of lower frequency time series as opposed to a
    smaller amount of high frequency time series such as real time data from measuring devices.
    Hence timeseriesdb provides the opportunity to store extensive multi-lingual
    meta information. The package also provides a web GUI to explore the underlying
    PostgreSQL database interactively.
