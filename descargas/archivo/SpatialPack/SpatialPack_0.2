Description: This package provides tools to assess the association
        between two spatial processes.  Currently, three methodologies
        are implemented: An adapted t test to perform hypothesis
        testing about the independence between the processes, a
        suitable nonparametric correlation coefficient, and the
        codispersion coefficient. Spatools gives methods to complement
        methodologies that are available in geoR for one spatial
        process.
