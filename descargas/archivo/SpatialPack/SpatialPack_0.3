Description: Tools to assess the association between two spatial processes. Currently,
  four methodologies are implemented: A modified t-test to perform hypothesis testing
  about the independence between the processes, a suitable nonparametric correlation
  coefficient, the codispersion coefficient, and an F test for assessing the multiple
  correlation between one spatial process and several others. SpatialPack gives methods
  to complement methodologies that are available in geoR for one spatial process.
