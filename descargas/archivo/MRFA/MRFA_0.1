Description: Performs the MRFA approach proposed by Sung et al. (unpublished) to fit
    and predict nonlinear regression problems, particularly for large-scale and
    high-dimensional problems. The application includes deterministic or stochastic
    computer experiments, spatial datasets, and so on.
