Title: Directional Penalties for Optimal Matching in Observational
        Studies
Version: 0.1.1

Description: Improves the balance of optimal matching with near-fine balance by giving penalties on the unbalanced covariates with the unbalanced directions. Many directional penalties can also be viewed as Lagrange multipliers, pushing a matched sample in the direction of satisfying a linear constraint that would not be satisfied without penalization.

Note: One minimum cost flow problem may have several or many solutions
        that are equivalent in providing the same minimum total or mean
        cost. Minor differences between computers or implementations
        may have the minor consequence of altering which equivalent
        solution is produced.
