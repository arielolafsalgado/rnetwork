Title: Gamma Shape Mixture
Version: 1.3.1
Date: 2014-02-21
Description: This package implements a Bayesian approach for estimation of a mixture of gamma distributions in which the mixing occurs over the shape parameter.
	This family provides a flexible and novel approach for modeling heavy-tailed distributions, it is computationally efficient, and it only requires to specify
	a prior distribution for a single parameter.
