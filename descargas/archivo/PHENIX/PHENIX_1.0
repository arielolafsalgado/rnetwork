Description: Provides functions to estimate the size-controlled phenotypic integration index, a novel method by Torices & Méndez (2014) to solve problems due to individual size when estimating integration (namely, larger individuals have larger components, which will drive a correlation between components only due to resource availability that might overestimate the observed measures of integration). In addition, the package also provides the classical estimation by Wagner (1984) and a bootstrapping method to test the significance of both integration indices.
