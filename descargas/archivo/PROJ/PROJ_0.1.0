Description: A wrapper around the generic coordinate transformation software 'PROJ'
 that transforms geospatial coordinates from one coordinate reference system ('CRS') to another. This 
  includes cartographic projections as well as geodetic transformations. Version 6.0.0 or 
  higher is required. The intention is for this package to be used by user-packages such 
  as 'reproj', and that the older 'PROJ.4' and version 5 pathways be provided by the 
  legacy package. The 'PROJ' library is available from <https://proj.org/>.
