Description: Given an RNA-seq derived cell-by-gene matrix and an DNA-seq derived copy number segmentation, LIAYSON predicts the number of clones present in a tumor, their size, the copy number profile of each clone and the clone membership of each single cell (Andor, N. & Lau, B., et al. (2018) <doi:10.1101/445932>).
