Description: HiClimR package modifies and improves hierarchical clustering in R
             ('hclust' function in 'stats' library), for climate regionalization. It adds a new
             clustering method (called, regional linkage) to the set of available methods together
             with several features including regridding, coarsening spatial resolution, geographic
             masking, data thresholds, detrending and standardization preprocessing, faster correlation
             function, hybrid hierarchical clustering, and cluster validation.
             Badr et. al (2014) describes the regionalization algorithms and data processing tools
             included in the package and presents a demonstration application in which the package
             is used to regionalize Africa on the basis of interannual precipitation variability.
             It is applicable to any correlation-based clustering.
