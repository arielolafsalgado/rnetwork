Description: HiClimR package modifies and improves hierarchical clustering in R ('hclust' function in 'stats'
             library), for climate regionalization. It adds a new clustering method (called, regional linkage)
             to the set of available methods together with several features including regridding, coarsening
             spatial resolution, geographic masking, data thresholds, detrending and standardization data
             preprocessing, faster correlation function, hybrid hierarchical clustering, and cluster validation.
             It is applicable to any correlation-based clustering.
