Description: Uniform manifold approximation and projection is a technique
    for dimension reduction. The algorithm was described by McInnes and
    Healy (2018) in <arXiv:1802.03426>. This package provides an interface
    for two implementations. One is written from scratch, including components
    for nearest-neighbor search and for embedding. The second implementation
    is a wrapper for 'python' package 'umap-learn' (requires separate
    installation, see vignette for more details).
