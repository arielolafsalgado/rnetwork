Description: If results from a meta-GWAS are used for validation in one of the cohorts that was included in the meta-analysis, this will yield biased (i.e. too optimistic) results. The validation cohort needs to be independent from the meta-Genome-Wide-Association-Study (meta-GWAS) results. 'MetaSubtract' will subtract the results of the respective cohort from the meta-GWAS results analytically without having to redo the meta-GWAS analysis using the leave-one-out methodology. It can handle different meta-analyses methods and takes into account if single or double genomic control correction was applied to the original meta-analysis. It can also handle different meta-analysis methods. It can be used for whole GWAS, but also for a limited set of genetic markers.
