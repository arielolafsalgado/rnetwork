Description: It contains functions that solve least squares linear
	     regression problems under linear equality/inequality
	     constraints. Functions for solving quadratic programming
	     problems are also available, which transform such problems
	     into least squares ones first. It is developed based on the
	     'Fortran' program of Lawson and Hanson (1974, 1995), which is
	     public domain and available at
	     <http://www.netlib.org/lawson-hanson>.
