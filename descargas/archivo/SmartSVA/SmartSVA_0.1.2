Description: Introduces a fast and efficient Surrogate Variable Analysis algorithm that captures variation of unknown sources (batch effects) for high-dimensional data sets. The algorithm is built on the 'irwsva.build' function of the 'sva' package and proposes a revision on it that achieves more than 10 times faster running time while trading no accuracy loss in return.
