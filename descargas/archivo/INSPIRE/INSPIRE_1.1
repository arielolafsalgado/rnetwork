Description: A method to infer modules of co-expressed genes and the
    dependencies among the modules from multiple expression datasets that may
    contain different sets of genes. Please refer to: Extracting a low-dimensional
    description of multiple gene expression datasets reveals a potential driver for
    tumor-associated stroma in ovarian cancer, Safiye Celik, Benjamin A. Logsdon,
