Description: Adsorption isotherm equations are linearized plots of different solid-liquid phase equilibria used in calculating different parameters related to the adsorption process. Isotherm equations deals with physical adsorption of gases and  vapor and gives the most important characteristics  of industrial adsorbents that include pore volume, pore size or energy distribution. PUPAIM has 28 documented adsorption isotherm models listed by Dabrowski (2001) <doi:10.1016/S0001-8686(00)00082-8> and Ayawei et al.(2017) <doi:10.1155/2017/3039817>. These models could be easily  fitted in R using adsorption data (Ce and Qe) obtained from experiments.
