Description: Several cubic spline interpolation methods of H. Akima for irregular and
  regular gridded data are available through this package, both for the bivariate case
  (irregular data: ACM 526 and ACM 761, regular data: ACM 433) and univariate case (ACM 697).
  Linear interpolation of irregular gridded data is also covered by reusing D. J. Renkas
  triangulation code which is part of Akimas Fortran code.
