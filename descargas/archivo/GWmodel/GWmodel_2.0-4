Description: In GWmodel, we introduce techniques from a particular branch of spatial statistics,termed geographically-weighted (GW) models. GW models suit situations when data are not described well by some global model, but where there are spatial regions where a suitably localised calibration provides a better description. GWmodel includes functions to calibrate: GW summary statistics, GW principal components analysis, GW discriminant analysis and various forms of GW regression; some of which are provided in basic and robust (outlier resistant) forms.
