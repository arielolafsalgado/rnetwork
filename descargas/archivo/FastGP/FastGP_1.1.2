Title: Efficiently Using Gaussian Processes with Rcpp and RcppEigen
Version: 1.1.2

Description: Contains Rcpp and RcppEigen implementations of matrix operations useful for Gaussian process models, such as the inversion of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix, sampling from multivariate normal distributions, evaluation of the log-density of a multivariate normal vector, and Bayesian inference for latent variable Gaussian process models with elliptical slice sampling (Murray, Adams, and MacKay 2010). Please see an eprint at http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.06055.pdf for more details.
