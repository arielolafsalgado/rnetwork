Title: Beautiful Graphical Representation of Multiplication Tables on a
        Modular Circle
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: person("Vincent", "Guyader", email = "vincent@thinkr.fr", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: By placing on a circle 10 points numbered from 1 to 10, and connecting them by a straight line to the point corresponding to its multiplication by 2. (1 must be connected to 1 * 2 = 2, point 2 must be set to 2 * 2 = 4, point 3 to 3 * 2 = 6 and so on). You will obtain an amazing geometric figure that complicates and beautifies itself by varying the number of points and the multiplication table you use.
