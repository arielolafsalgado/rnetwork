Description: Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) is a computational method that is used to solve optimization problems of different types and it is the mathematical model and the computer simulation of human social evolution. 
         The package provides a minimum value for the cost function and the best value for the optimization variables by Imperialist Competitive Algorithm.
         Users can easily define their own objective function depending on the problem at hand.
         This version has been successfully applied to solve optimization problems, for continuous functions.
