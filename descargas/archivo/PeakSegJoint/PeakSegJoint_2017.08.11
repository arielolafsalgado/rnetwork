Title: Joint Peak Detection in Several ChIP-Seq Samples
Description: Jointly segment several ChIP-seq samples to find the peaks 
 which are the same and different across samples. The fast approximate
 maximum Poisson likelihood algorithm is described in
 "PeakSegJoint: fast supervised peak detection via joint segmentation
 of multiple count data samples"
