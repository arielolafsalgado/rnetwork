Description: One can easily draw the membership function of f(x,y) by package 'FuzzyNumbers.Ext.2' in which f(.,.) is supposed monotone and x and y are two fuzzy numbers. This work is possible using function f2apply() which is an extension of function fapply() from Package 'FuzzyNumbers' for two-variable monotone functions. Moreover, this package has the ability of computing the core, support and alpha-cuts of the fuzzy-valued final result.
