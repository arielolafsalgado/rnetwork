Title: Read and Write 'FreeSurfer' Neuroimaging File Formats
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Tim Schäfer
Maintainer: Tim Schäfer <ts+code@rcmd.org>
Description: Provides functions to read and write data from neuroimaging files in 'FreeSurfer' <http://freesurfer.net/> binary formats. This includes the following file formats: 1) MGH/MGZ format files, which can contain multi-dimensional images or other data. Typically they contain time-series of three-dimensional brain scans acquired by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They can also contain vertex-wise measures of surface morphometry data. The MGH format is named after the Massachusetts General Hospital, and the MGZ format is a compressed version of the same format. 2) 'FreeSurfer' morphometry data files in binary 'curv' format. These contain vertex-wise surface measures, i.e., one scalar value for each vertex of a brain surface mesh. These are typically values like the cortical thickness or brain surface area at each vertex. 3) Annotation file format. This contains a brain surface parcellation derived from a cortical atlas. 4) Surface file format. Contains a brain surface mesh, given by a list of vertices and a list of faces.
