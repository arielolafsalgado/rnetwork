Description: Contains functions for importing and exporting 'dendrogram' 
    objects in parenthetic text format, and several 
    functions for command-line tree manipulation. 
    With an emphasis on speed and computational efficiency, 
    the package also includes a suite of tools for rapidly computing 
    distance matrices and building large trees using fast alignment-free 
    'k-mer' counting and divisive clustering techniques.
