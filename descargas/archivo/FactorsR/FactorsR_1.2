Title: Identification of the Factors Affecting Species Richness
Author: Cástor Guisande González
Maintainer: Cástor Guisande González <castor@uvigo.es>
Description: It identifies the factors significantly related to species richness, and their relative contribution, using multiple regressions and support vector machine models. It uses an output file of 'ModestR' (<http://www.ipez.es/ModestR>) with data of richness of the species and environmental variables in a cell size defined by the user. The residuals of the support vector machine model are shown on a map. Negative residuals may be potential areas with undiscovered and/or unregistered species, or areas with decreased species richness due to the negative effect of anthropogenic factors.
