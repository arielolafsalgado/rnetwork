Description: Tables with state-of-the-art layout elements such as
    row spanners, column spanners, table spanners, zebra striping,
    and more. While allowing advanced layout, the underlying CSS structure is
    simple in order to maximize compatibility with word processors such as
    MS Word or LibreOffice.
    The package also contains a few text formatting functions that help outputting
    text compatible with HTML/LaTeX.
