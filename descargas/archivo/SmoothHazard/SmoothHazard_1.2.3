Title: Fitting illness-death model for interval-censored data
Version: 1.2.3
Author: Celia Touraine, Pierre Joly, Thomas A. Gerds
Description: SmoothHazard is a package for fitting illness-death (and survival)
    model with possibly interval-censored data for transition toward transient
    state. Left-truncated and right-censored data are also allowed.
    Proportional intensities regression models allow for covariates on each of
    the 3 transitions. We use either a parametric approach with Weibull
    baseline intensities or a semi-parametric approach with M-splines
    approximation of baseline intensities in order to obtain smooth estimates.
    Estimation of parameters is conducted by likelihood maximization in the
    parametric approach or penalized likelihood maximization in the
    semi-parametric approach.
