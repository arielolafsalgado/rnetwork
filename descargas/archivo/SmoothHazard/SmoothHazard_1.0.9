Title: Fitting illness-death model for interval-censored data
Version: 1.0.9
Author: Celia Touraine, Pierre Joly, Thomas A. Gerds
Description: SmoothHazard is a package for fitting illness-death (and
        survival) model with possibly interval-censored data for
        transition toward transient state. Left-truncated and
        right-censored data are also allowed. Proportional intensities
        regression models allow for covariates on each of the 3
        transitions. We use either a parametric approach with Weibull
        baseline intensities or a semi-parametric approach with
        M-splines approximation of baseline intensities in order to
        obtain smooth estimates. Estimation of parameters is conducted
        by likelihood maximization in the parametric approach or
        penalized likelihood maximization in the semi-parametric
        approach.
