Description: Functions are provided to calculate and display ridge TRACEs for various
  shrinkage PATHS. They determine the m-Extent of shrinkage most likely, under
  Normal-distribution theory, to produce biased estimates of regression (beta) coefficients
  with minimum MSE Risk. An alternative function, correct.signs(), provides beta coefficient
  estimates when an ill-conditioned (nearly multicollinear) model yields OLS estimates with
  ("wrong") numerical signs that disagree with the signs of the observed correlations between
  the Y-outcome and the selected X-predictor variables.
