Description: Identify and display TRACEs for a specified shrinkage path and determine
  the extent of shrinkage most likely, under normal distribution theory, to produce an
  optimal reduction in MSE Risk in estimates of regression (beta) coefficients. Alternative
  estimates are also provided when ill-conditioned (nearly multicollinear) models yield
  OLS estimates with "wrong" numerical signs.
