Description: Simulate and analyze multistate models with general hazard
    functions. gems provides functionality for the preparation of hazard functions
    and parameters, simulation from a general multistate model and predicting future
    events. The multistate model is not required to be a Markov model and may take
    the history of previous events into account. In the basic version, it allows
    to simulate from transition-specific hazard function, whose parameters are
    multivariable normally distributed.
