Description: Simulate and analyze multistate models with general hazard functions. gems provides functionality for the preparation of hazard functions and parameters, simulation from a general multistate model and predicting future events. The multistate model is not required to be a Markov model and may take the history of previous events into account. In the basic version, it allows to simulate from transition-specific hazard function, whose parameters are multivariable normally distributed.
