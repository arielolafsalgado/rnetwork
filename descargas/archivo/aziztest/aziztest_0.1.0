Description: Testing for heterogeneous effects in a case-control setting.
    The aim here to discover an association that is beyond a mean difference
    between all cases and all controls. Instead, the signal of interest here
    is present in only a proportion of the cases. This test should be more 
    powerful than a t-test or Wilcoxon test in this heterogeneous setting.
