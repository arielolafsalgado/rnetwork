Description: Estimates the precision of transdimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo 
    (MCMC) output, which is often used for Bayesian analysis of models with different 
    dimensionality (e.g., model selection). Transdimensional MCMC (e.g., reversible 
    jump MCMC) relies on sampling a discrete model-indicator variable to estimate 
    the posterior model probabilities. If only few switches occur between the models, 
    precision may be low and assessment based on the assumption of independent 
    samples misleading. Based on the observed transition matrix of the indicator 
    variable, the method of Heck, Overstall, Gronau, & Wagenmakers (2018, 
    Statistics & Computing) <doi:10.1007/s11222-018-9828-0> draws posterior samples 
    of the stationary distribution to (a) assess the uncertainty in the estimated 
    posterior model probabilities and (b) estimate the effective sample size of 
    the MCMC output.
