Description: This package implements poisson-lognormal generalized linear mixed model analysis of multivariate counts data using MCMC, aiming to infer the changes in relative proportions of individual variables. The package was originally designed for sequence-based analysis of microbial communities ("metabarcoding", variables = operational taxonomic units, OTUs), but can be used for other types of multivariate counts, such as in ecological applications (variables = species). The results are summarized and plotted using ggplot2 functions. Includes functions to remove sample and variable outliers and reformat counts into normalized log-transformed values for correlation and principal component/coordinate analysis.
