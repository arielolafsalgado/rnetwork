Description: Implementation of the Taylor Regression Estimator method described in Christopoulos (2014,<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261562841>)
 for finding the root, extreme or inflection point of a curve, when we only have a set of probably noisy xy points for it. The method uses a suitable
 polynomial regression in order to find the coefficients of the relevant Taylor polynomial for the function that has generated our data.
