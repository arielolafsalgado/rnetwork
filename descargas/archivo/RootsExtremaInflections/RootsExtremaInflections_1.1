Description: Implementation of the Taylor Regression Estimator method which is described
 in Christopoulos (2014,<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261562841>) for finding
 the root, extreme or inflection point of a curve, when we only have a set of probably noisy
 xy points for it. The method uses a suitable polynomial regression in order to find the
 coefficients of the relevant Taylor polynomial for the function that has generated our data.
 Optional use of parallel computing under request.
