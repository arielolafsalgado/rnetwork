Title: Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics
Description: Provides optimized functions implemented in C++ with 'Rcpp' for
    solving problems in combinatorics and computational mathematics. There is
    a combination function and a permutation function that are both flexible as
    well as efficient with respect to speed and memory. There are optional
    constraint parameters that when utilized, generate all combinations/
    permutations of a vector meeting specific criteria (e.g. finding all
    combinations such that the sum is less than a bound). Both functions are
    capable of handling multisets as well. Additionally, there are several 
    highly efficient number theoretic functions that are useful for problems
    common in computational mathematics. These include various sieving
    functions that can quickly generate the following: prime numbers, number of
    coprime elements, number of divisors, prime factorizations, and complete
    factorizations. Some of these functions make use of the fast integer
    division library 'libdivide' by <http://ridiculousfish.com>. The primeSieve
    function is based on the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes implementation by
    Kim Walisch. It is capable of generating all primes less than a billion in
    just over 1 second. It can also quickly generate prime numbers over a range
    (e.g. primeSieve(10^13, 10^13+10^9)). There are stand-alone vectorized
    functions for general factoring (e.g. all divisors of number), primality
    testing, as well as prime factoring (this function implements a non-gmp
    variant of Pollard's rho algorithm). Finally, there is a prime counting
    function that implements a simple variation of Legendre's formula based off
    of the algorithm by Kim Walisch. It is capable of returning the number of
    primes below a trillion in under 0.5 seconds.
