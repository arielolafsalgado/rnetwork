Title: Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics
Description: Provides optimized functions implemented in C++ with 'Rcpp'
    for solving problems in combinatorics and computational mathematics.
    There is a combination function and a permutation function that are
    both flexible as well as efficient with respect to speed and memory.
    There are optional constraint parameters that when utilized, generate
    all combinations/permutations of a vector meeting a specific criteria
    (E.g. finding all combinations such that the sum is less than a
    bound). Both functions are capable of handling mulitsets as well.
    Additionally, there are various sieving functions that quickly
    generate essential components for problems common in computational
    mathematics (E.g. number of coprime elements, divisors, prime
    factorizations, and complete factorizations for many numbers as
    well as primes numbers in a range).
