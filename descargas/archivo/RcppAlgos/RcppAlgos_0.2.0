Title: Tools for Combinatorics and Computational Mathematics
Description: Provides optimized functions implemented in C++ with 'Rcpp'
    for solving problems in combinatorics and computational mathematics.
    There is a combination function and a permutation function that are
    both flexible as well as efficient with respect to speed and memory.
    There are optional contraint arguments that when employed, generate
    all combinations/permutations of a vector meeting a specific criteria
    (E.g. finding all combinations such that the sum is less than a
    bound). The generalized permutation function is also capable of 
    producing all permutations of multisets. Additionally, there are
    various sieving functions that quickly generate essential components
    for problems common in computational mathematics (E.g. number of
    comprime elements, divisors, prime factorizations, and complete
    factorizations for many numbers as well as primes in a range).
