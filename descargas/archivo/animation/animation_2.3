Description: This package contains a variety of functions for animations in
    statistics, covering areas such as probability theory, mathematical
    statistics, multivariate statistics, nonparametric statistics, sampling
    survey, linear models, time series, computational statistics, data mining
    and machine learning. These functions might be helpful in teaching
    statistics and data analysis. Also provided in this package are several
    approaches to save animations to various formats, e.g. Flash, GIF, HTML
    pages, PDF and videos (saveSWF(), saveGIF(), saveHTML(), saveLatex(), and
    saveVideo() respectively). PDF animations can be inserted into Sweave/knitr
    easily.
SystemRequirements: ImageMagick (http://imagemagick.org) or
        GraphicsMagick (http://www.graphicsmagick.org) or LyX
        (http://www.lyx.org) for saveGIF(); (PDF)LaTeX for saveLatex();
        SWF Tools (http://swftools.org) for saveSWF(); FFmpeg
        (http://ffmpeg.org) for saveVideo()
