Package: gibble
Title: Component Geometry Decomposition
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Michael", "Sumner", email = "mdsumner@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Translation and restructuring operations for planar shapes and
 other hierarchical types require a data model with a record of the underlying
 relationships between elements. The gibble() function creates a geometry map,
 a simple record of the underlying structure in path-based hierarchical types.
 There are methods for the planar shape types in the 'sf' package.
