Description: Build a map of path-based geometry, this is a simple description of the number
 of parts in an object and their basic structure. Translation and restructuring operations for 
 planar shapes and other hierarchical types require a data model with a record of the underlying
 relationships between elements. The gibble() function creates a geometry map, a simple record of 
 the underlying structure in path-based hierarchical types. There are methods for the planar shape 
 types in the 'sf' and 'sp' packages.
