Description: Simultaneous tests and confidence intervals are provided for one-way experimental designs with one or many normally distributed, primary response variables (endpoints). Differences (Hasler and Hothorn, 2011) or ratios (Hasler and Hothorn, 2012) of means can be considered. Various contrasts can be chosen, unbalanced sample sizes are allowed as well as heterogeneous variances (Hasler and Hothorn, 2008) or covariance matrices (Hasler, 2014).
