Description: Simultaneous tests and confidence intervals for one-way
        experimental designs with one or many normally distributed,
        primary response variables (endpoints). The procedure of Hasler
        (2009) is applied for differences or ratios of means. Various
        contrasts can be chosen, unbalanced sample sizes are allowed as
        well as heterogeneous covariance matrices.
