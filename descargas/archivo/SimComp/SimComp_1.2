Description: Simultaneous tests and confidence intervals for general
             linear hypotheses when there is more than one primary 
             response variable (endpoint). The procedure of Hasler
             (2008) is applied for differences or ratios of means of
             normally distributed data. The covariance matrices
             (containing the covariances between the endpoints) may
             be assumed to be equal or possibly unequal for the
             different groups.
