Description: Simultaneous tests and confidence intervals for general
        linear hypotheses when there is more than one primary response
        variable (endpoint). The procedure of Hasler (2009) is applied
        for differences or ratios of means of normally distributed
        data. The covariance matrices (containing the covariances
        between the endpoints) may be assumed to be equal or possibly
        unequal for the different groups.
