Description: Simultaneous tests and confidence intervals for one-way
        experimental designs with one or many normally distributed,
        primary response variables (endpoints). The procedure of Hasler
        and Hothorn (2011) is applied for differences or ratios of
        means. Various contrasts can be chosen, unbalanced sample sizes
        are allowed as well as heterogeneous variances or covariance
        matrices.
