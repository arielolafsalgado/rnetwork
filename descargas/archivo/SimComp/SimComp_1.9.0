Description: Simultaneous tests and confidence intervals for one-way
        experimental designs with one or many normally distributed,
        primary response variables (endpoints).  The procedure of
        Hasler and Hothorn (2011,2012) is applied for differences or
        ratios of means. Various contrasts can be chosen, unbalanced
        sample sizes are allowed as well as heterogeneous variances or
        covariance matrices.
