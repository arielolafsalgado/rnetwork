Description: steepness is a package that computes steepness as a
        property of dominance hierarchies. Steepness is defined as the
        absolute slope of the straight line fitted to the normalized
        David's scores. The normalized David's scores can be obtained
        on the basis of dyadic dominance indices corrected for chance.
        Given an observed sociomatrix, it computes hierarchy's
        steepness and estimates statistical significance by means of a
        randomization test.
