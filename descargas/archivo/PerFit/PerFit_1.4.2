Description: Several person-fit statistics (PFSs) are offered. These statistics allow assessing whether
  individual response patterns to tests or questionnaires are (im)plausible given 
  the other respondents in the sample or given a specified item response theory model. Some PFSs apply to 
  dichotomous data, such as the likelihood-based PFSs (lz, lz*) and the group-based PFSs 
  (personal biserial correlation, caution index, (normed) number of Guttman errors, 
  agreement/disagreement/dependability statistics, U3, ZU3, NCI, Ht). PFSs suitable to polytomous data include
  extensions of lz, U3, and (normed) number of Guttman errors.
