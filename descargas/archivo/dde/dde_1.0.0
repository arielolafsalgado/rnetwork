Description: Solves ordinary and delay differential equations, where
    the objective function is written in either R or C.  Suitable only
    for non-stiff equations, the solver uses a 'Dormand-Prince' method
    that allows interpolation of the solution at any point.  This
    approach is as described by Hairer, Norsett and Wanner (1993)
    <ISBN:3540604529>.  Support is also included for iterating
    difference equations.
