Description: Fits a linear model to survey data in each node obtained by 
    recursively partitioning the data.  The splitting variables and splits
    selected are obtained using a procedure which adjusts for complex sample
    design features used to obtain the data. Likewise the model fitting
    algorithm produces design-consistent coefficients to the least squares
    linear model between the dependent and independent variables.
    The first stage of the design is accounted for in the provided variance 
    estimates. The main function returns the resulting binary tree with the 
    linear model fit at every end-node. The package provides a number of 
    functions and methods for these trees.
