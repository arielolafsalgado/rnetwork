Description: A Bayesian-weighted estimator and two unweighted estimators are
 developed to estimate the number of newly found rare species in additional
 ecological samples. Among these methods, the Bayesian-weighted estimator
 and an unweighted (Chao-derived) estimator are of high accuracy and
 recommended for practical applications.
 Technical details of the proposed estimators have been well described
 in the following paper: Shen TJ, Chen YH (2018) A Bayesian
 weighted approach to predicting the number of newly discovered
 rare species. Conservation Biology, In press.
