Description: A collection of functions for conducting meta-analysis using a
             structural equation modeling (SEM) approach via the 'OpenMx' and
			 'lavaan' packages. It also implements the two-stage SEM approach
			 to conduct meta-analytic structural equation modeling on
			 correlation and covariance matrices.
