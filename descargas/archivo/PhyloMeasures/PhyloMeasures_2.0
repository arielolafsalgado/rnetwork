Description: Given a phylogenetic tree T and an assemblage S of species represented as 
             a subset of tips in T, we want to compute a measure of the diversity 
             of the species in S with respect to T. The current package offers 
             efficient algorithms that can process large phylogenetic data for several such measures. 
             Most importantly, the package includes algorithms for computing 
             efficiently the standardized versions of phylogenetic measures and their p-values, which are 
             essential for null model comparisons. Among other functions, 
             the package provides efficient computation of richness-standardized versions 
             for indices such as the net relatedness index (NRI), 
             nearest taxon index (NTI), phylogenetic
             diversity index (PDI), and the corresponding indices of two-sample measures. 
             The package also introduces a new
             single-sample measure, the Core Ancestor Cost (CAC); the package provides
             functions for computing the value and the standardised index of the CAC and,
             more than that, there is an extra function available that can compute exactly 
             any statistical moment of the measure. The package supports computations
             under different null models, including abundance-weighted models.
