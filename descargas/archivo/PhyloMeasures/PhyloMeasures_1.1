Description: Given a phylogenetic tree T and a sample S of species represented as 
             a subset of tips in T, we want to compute a measure of the diversity 
             of the species in S with respect to T. The current package offers the 
             implementations of efficient algorithms for several such measures. 
             Most importantly, the package includes algorithms for computing exactly and 
             efficiently the expectation and the variance of these measures, which are 
             essential for null model comparisons. Efficient computation of
             richness-standardized versions of these metrics, such as the net
             relatedness index (NRI), nearest taxon index (NTI), phylogenetic
             diversity index (PDI), and the corresponding indices of two-sample measures 
             are also available in this package. The package also introduces a new
             single-sample measure, the Core Ancestor Cost (CAC); the package provides
             functions for computing the value and the standardised index of the CAC and,
             more than that, there is an extra function available that can compute exactly 
             any statistical moment of the measure.
