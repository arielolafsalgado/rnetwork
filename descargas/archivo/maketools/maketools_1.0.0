Description: Packages with C, C++, or Fortran code require a properly configured 
    toolchain and sometimes external system dependencies to build. Because these
    things vary a lot by platform, getting this all to work can be challenging. 
    The 'maketools' package contains a collection of helper functions that interface
    with the appropriate system utilities to learn about the build environment. 
    It lets you explore 'make' rules to test the local configuration, or query 
    'pkg-config' <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/> to find
    the cflags and libs needed for building packages with external dependencies. 
    It also contains tools to analyze which libraries that a installed R package
    is linked to, by inspecting output from 
    'ldd' <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ldd.1.html> in combination with
    information from the distribution package manager, e.g. 'rpm' or 'dpkg'. For 
    Windows there are special utilities to automatically find or install the 
    suitable version of the 'Rtools' <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>
    build environment, and diagnose some common problems.
