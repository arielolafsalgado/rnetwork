Description: Fits the space-time Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence
    (ETAS) model to earthquake catalogs using a stochastic declustering 
    approach. The ETAS model is a spatio-temporal marked point process
    model and a special case of the Hawkes process. The package is based 
    on a Fortran program by Jiancang Zhuang
    (available at <http://bemlar.ism.ac.jp/zhuang/software.html>),
    which is modified and translated into C++ and C such that it 
    can be called from R. Parallel computing with OpenMP is possible 
    on supported platforms.
