Title: Modeling Earthquake Data Using 'ETAS' Model
Description: Fits the space-time Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence
    ('ETAS') model to earthquake catalogs using a stochastic 'declustering' 
    approach. The 'ETAS' model is a 'spatio-temporal' marked point process
    model and a special case of the 'Hawkes' process. The package is based 
    on a Fortran program by 'Jiancang Zhuang'
    (available at <http://bemlar.ism.ac.jp/zhuang/software.html>),
    which is modified and translated into C++ and C such that it 
    can be called from R. Parallel computing with 'OpenMP' is possible 
    on supported platforms.
