Description: Fits the space-time Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence
    (ETAS) model to earthquake catalogs
    using a stochastic declustering approach.
    The ETAS model is a spatio-temporal marked point process
    model and a special case of the Hawkes process.
    The package is based on Fortran code by Jiancang Zhuang
    (available at <http://bemlar.ism.ac.jp/zhuang/software.html>),
    which is translated into C++ and C such that it can be called from R.
