Description: This package implements Bayesian hierarchical spatial areal unit models. In such models the spatial correlation is modelled by  a set of random effects, which are assigned a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution. Examples of the models included are the BYM model as well as a recently developed localised spatial smoothing model.The creation of this package was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant RES-000-22-4256.
