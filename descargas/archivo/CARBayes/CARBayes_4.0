Description: Implements Bayesian hierarchical spatial areal unit models. In such models the spatial autocorrelation is modelled by  a set of random effects, which are assigned a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution. Examples of the models included are the BYM model as well as a recently developed localised spatial smoothing model.The initial creation of this package was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) grant RES-000-22-4256, and on-going development is supported by the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) grant EP/J017442/1.
