Description: Methods include converting series of event names to strings,
    discovering common patterns in a group of strings, discovering "unique" patterns
    when comparing two groups of strings as well as the number and starting position
    of each "unique" pattern in each string, finding the transition matrix and information, and
    statistically comparing the difference between two groups of strings.
