Description: This software has evolved from fisheries research conducted at the
   Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada. It
   extends the R language to include two-dimensional plotting features similar
   to those commonly available in a Geographic Information System (GIS).
   Embedded C code speeds algorithms from computational geometry, such as
   finding polygons that contain specified point events or converting between
   longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.
   Additionally, we include C++ code developed by Angus Johnson for the Clipper
   library.  PBSmapping also includes data for a global shoreline and other
   data sets in the public domain.
   The R directory '.../library/PBSmapping/doc' offers a complete user's
   guide PBSmapping-UG.pdf, which should be consulted to use all functions in
   the package effectively.
