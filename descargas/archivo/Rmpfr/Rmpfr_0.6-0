Description: Arithmetic (via S4 classes and methods) for
  arbitrary precision floating point numbers, including transcendental
  ("special") functions.  To this end, Rmpfr interfaces to
  the LGPL'ed MPFR (Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable) Library
  which itself is based on the GMP (GNU Multiple Precision) Library.
