Description: Simulates judgments of frequency and duration based on
    the Probability Associator Time (PASS-T) model. PASS-T is a memory
    model based on a simple competitive artificial neural network. It 
    can imitate human judgments of frequency and duration, which have
    been extensively studied in cognitive psychology
    (e.g. Hintzman (1970) <doi:10.1037/h0028865>, Betsch et al. (2010)
    <https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-18204-003>). The PASS-T model
    is an extension of the PASS model (Sedlmeier, 2002,
    ISBN:0198508638). The package provides an easy way to run
    simulations, which can then be compared with empirical data in
    human judgments of frequency and duration.
