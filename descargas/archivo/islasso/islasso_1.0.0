Description: An implementation of the induced smoothing idea that focuses on hypothesis testing in lasso regularization models (IS-lasso). Linear, logistic, Poisson and gamma regressions with several link functions are already implemented. The algorithm uses the steps as described in the original paper. See: The Induced Smoothed lasso: A practical framework for hypothesis testing in high dimensional regression. Cilluffo, G., Sottile, G., La Grutta, S. and Muggeo, V.
