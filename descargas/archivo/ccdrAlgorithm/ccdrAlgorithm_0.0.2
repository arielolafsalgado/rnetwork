Description: Implementation of the CCDr (Concave penalized Coordinate Descent with reparametrization) structure learning algorithm as described in Aragam and Zhou (2015) <http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v16/aragam15a.html>. This is a fast, score-based method for learning Bayesian networks that uses sparse regularization and block-cyclic coordinate descent.
