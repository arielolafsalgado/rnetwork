Description: Quantifying systematic heterogeneity in meta-analysis using R.
    The M statistic aggregates heterogeneity information across multiple
    variants to, identify systematic heterogeneity patterns and their direction
    of effect in meta-analysis. It's primary use is to identify outlier studies,
    which either show "null" effects or consistently show stronger or weaker
    genetic effects than average across, the panel of variants examined in a
    GWAS meta-analysis. In contrast to conventional heterogeneity metrics
    (Q-statistic, I-squared and tau-squared) which measure random heterogeneity
    at individual variants, M measures systematic (non-random)
    heterogeneity across multiple independently associated variants. Systematic
    heterogeneity can arise in a meta-analysis due to differences in the study
    characteristics of participating studies. Some of the differences may
    include: ancestry, allele frequencies, phenotype definition, age-of-disease
    onset, family-history, gender, linkage disequilibrium and quality control
    thresholds. See <https://magosil86.github.io/getmstatistic/> for statistical
    statistical theory, documentation and examples.
