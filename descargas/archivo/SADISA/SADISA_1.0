Description: Computes the probability of a set of species abundances of a single or multiple samples of individuals under a mainland-island model. One must specify the mainland (metacommunity) model and the island (local) community model. It assumes that species fluctuate independently. See Haegeman, B. & R.S. Etienne (2017).
