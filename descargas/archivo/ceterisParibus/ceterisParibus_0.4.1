Description: Ceteris Paribus Profiles (What-If Plots) are designed to present model 
    responses around selected points in a feature space. 
    For example around a single prediction for an interesting observation. 
    Plots are designed to work in a model-agnostic fashion, they are working 
    for any predictive Machine Learning model and allow for model comparisons.
    Ceteris Paribus Plots supplement the Break Down Plots from 'breakDown' package.
