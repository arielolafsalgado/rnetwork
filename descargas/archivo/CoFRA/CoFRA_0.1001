Version: 0.1001
Authors@R: person("Rune", "Matthiesen", email = "runem2009@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Calculates complete functional regulation analysis and visualize the results in a single heatmap. The provided example data is for biological data but the methodology can be used for large data sets to compare quantitative entities that can be grouped. For example, a store might divide entities into cloth, food, car products etc and want to see how sales changes in the groups after some event. The theoretical background for the calculations are provided in New insights into functional regulation in MS-based drug profiling, Ana Sofia Carvalho, Henrik Molina & Rune Matthiesen, Scientific Reports, <doi:10.1038/srep18826>.
