        ratio tests

Description: This package computes appropriate confidence intervals for the
    likelihood ratio tests commonly used in medicine/epidemiology.  It is
    particularly useful when the sensitivity or specificy in the sample is
    100%.  Note that this does not perform the test on nested models--for that,
    see epicalc::lrtest.
