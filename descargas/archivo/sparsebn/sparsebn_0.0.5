Description: Fast methods for learning sparse Bayesian networks from high-dimensional data using sparse regularization, as described in Aragam, Gu, and Zhou (2017) <arXiv:1703.04025>. Designed to handle mixed experimental and observational data with thousands of variables with either continuous or discrete observations.
