Description: Simulate survival times from standard parametric survival 
    distributions (exponential, Weibull, Gompertz), 2-component mixture 
    distributions, or a user-defined hazard or log hazard function. Baseline 
    covariates can be included under a proportional hazards assumption. Time 
    dependent effects (i.e. non-proportional hazards) can be included by 
    interacting covariates with linear time or some transformation of time.
    The 2-component mixture distributions can allow for a variety of flexible
    baseline hazard functions. If the user wishes to provide a user-defined 
    hazard or log hazard function then this is also possible, and the resulting
    cumulative hazard function does not need to have a closed-form solution. 
    Note that this package is modelled on the 'survsim' package available in 
    the 'Stata' software (see Crowther and Lambert (2012) 
    <http://www.stata-journal.com/sjpdf.html?articlenum=st0275> or 
    Crowther and Lambert (2013) <doi:10.1002/sim.5823>).
