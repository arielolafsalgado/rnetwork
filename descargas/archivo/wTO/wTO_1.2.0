Description: Computes the Weighted Topological Overlap (wTO) networks. Once a data.frame containing the count/ expression/ abundance per sample, and a vector containing the interested nodes of interaction.It also computes the cut-off threshold or p-value based on the individuals bootstrap or the values reshuffle per individual. It also allows the construction of a Consensus network, based on multiple wTOs. Also includes a visualization tool for the final network.
