Description: Computes the Weighted Topological Overlap with positive and negative signs (wTO) networks (Nowick et al. (2009) <doi:10.1073/pnas.0911376106>) given a data frame containing the mRNA count/ expression/ abundance per sample, and a vector containing the interested nodes of interaction (a subset of the elements of the full data frame). It also computes the cut-off threshold or p-value based on the individuals bootstrap or the values reshuffle per individual. It also allows the construction of a consensus network, based on multiple wTO networks. The package includes a visualization tool for the networks.
