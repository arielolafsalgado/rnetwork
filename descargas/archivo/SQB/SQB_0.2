Title: Sequential Bagging on Regression
Description: Methodology: Remove one observation. Training the rest of data that are sampled without replacement and given this observation's input, predict the response back. Replicate this N times and for each response, take a sample from these replicates with replacement. Average each responses of sample and again replicate this step N time for each observation. Approximate these N new responses by using bootstrap method and generate another N responses y'. Training these y' and predict to have N responses of each testing observation. The average of N is the final prediction. Each observation will do the same.
