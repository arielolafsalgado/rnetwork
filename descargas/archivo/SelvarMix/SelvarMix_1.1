Description: Performs a regularization approach to variable selection in the
             model-based clustering and classification frameworks.
             First, the variables are arranged in order with a lasso-like procedure. 
             Second, the method of Maugis, Celeux, and Martin-Magniette (2009, 2011) 
             is adapted to define the role of variables in the two frameworks.
