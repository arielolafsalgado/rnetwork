Description: An implementation of the correction methods proposed by Shu and Yi (2017) <doi:10.1177/0962280217743777> for the inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimation of average treatment effect (ATE) with misclassified outcomes. Logistic regression model is assumed for treatment model for all implemented correction methods, and is assumed for the outcome model for the implemented doubly robust correction method.
