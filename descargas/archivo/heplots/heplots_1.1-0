Description: Provides HE plot and other functions for visualizing hypothesis tests in multivariate linear models. 
     HE plots represent sums-of-squares-and-products matrices for linear hypotheses and for error using ellipses 
     (in two dimensions) and ellipsoids (in three dimensions).  The related "candisc" package provides visualizations
     in a reduced-rank canonical discriminant space when there are more than a few response variables.
