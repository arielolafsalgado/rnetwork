Description: Classification is based on the recently developed phylogenetic
    approach by Assis and Bachtrog (2013). The method classifies the
    evolutionary mechanisms retaining pairs of duplicate genes (conservation,
    neofunctionalization, subfunctionalization, or specialization) by comparing gene
    expression profiles of duplicate genes in one species to those of their single-
    copy ancestral genes in a sister species.
