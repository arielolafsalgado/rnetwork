Description: Time series clustering along with optimized techniques related
    to the Dynamic Time Warping distance and its corresponding lower bounds.
    Implementations of k-Shape, TADPole and fuzzy clustering are available.
    The functionality can be easily extended with custom distance measures
    and centroid definitions.
