Description: An implementation of a cost constrained flux balance analysis technique (i.e. MetabOlic Modeling with ENzyme kineTics (MOMENT)).
             MOMENT uses enzyme kinetic data and enzyme molecular weights to constrain flux balance analysis(FBA) and it is described in 
			 Adadi, R., Volkmer, B., Milo, R., Heinemann, M., & Shlomi, T. (2012). Prediction of Microbial Growth Rate versus Biomass 
			 Yield by a Metabolic Network with Kinetic Parameters, 8(7). doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002575. 
             This package also implements an improvement of MOMENT that considers multi-functional enzymes. 
			 FBA is a mathematical technique to find fluxes in metabolic models at steady state. 
			 It is described in Orth, J.D., Thiele, I. and Palsson, B.O.  What is flux balance analysis? Nat. Biotech. 28, 245-248(2010).
