Description: Different techniques of cost constrained flux balance analysis.
        1- MetabOlic Modeling with ENzyme kineTics 'MOMENT' which uses enzyme kinetic data and enzyme molecular 
         weights to constrain flux balance analysis(FBA) and it is described in Adadi, R., Volkmer, B., Milo, R., 
         Heinemann, M., & Shlomi, T. (2012). Prediction of Microbial Growth Rate versus Biomass Yield by a Metabolic Network 
           with Kinetic Parameters, 8(7). <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002575>. 
        2- an improvement of 'MOMENT' that considers multi-functional enzymes 'ccFBA'. 
         Described in Desouki, Abdelmoneim. Algorithms for improving the predictive power of flux balance analysis. PhD dissertation, 2016.
         FBA is a mathematical technique to find fluxes in metabolic models at steady state. 
         It is described in Orth, J.D., Thiele, I. and Palsson, B.O.  What is flux balance analysis? Nat. Biotech. 28, 245-248(2010).
