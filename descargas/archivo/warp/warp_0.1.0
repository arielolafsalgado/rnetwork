Description: Tooling to group dates by a variety of periods
    including: yearly, monthly, by second, by week of the month, and more.
    The groups are defined in such a way that they also represent the
    distance between dates in terms of the period. This extracts valuable
    information that can be used in further calculations that rely on a
    specific temporal spacing between observations.
