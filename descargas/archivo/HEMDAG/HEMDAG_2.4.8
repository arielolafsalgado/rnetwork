Description: An implementation of several Hierarchical Ensemble Methods (HEMs) for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). 'HEMDAG' package: 1) reconciles flat predictions with the topology of the ontology; 2) can enhance predictions of virtually any flat learning methods by taking into account the hierarchical relationships between ontology classes; 3) always provides biologically consistent predictions according to the hierarchical nature of the ontology classes; 4) is specifically designed for exploiting the hierarchical relationships of DAG-structured taxonomies, such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) or the Gene Ontology (GO), but can be safely applied to tree-structured taxonomies as well (e.g. FunCat), since trees are DAGs; 5) scales nicely both in terms of the complexity of the taxonomy and in the cardinality of the examples; 6) provides several utility functions to process and analyze graphs; 7) provides several performance metrics to evaluate HEMs algorithms.
