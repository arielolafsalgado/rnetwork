Description: Estimates time varying regression effects under Cox type models in
    survival data using classification and regression tree. The codes in this package were 
    originally written in S-Plus for the paper "Survival Analysis with Time-Varying Regression
    Effects Using a Tree-Based Approach," by Xu, R. and Adak, S. (2002) <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2002.00305.x>, Biometrics, 58: 305-315.
    Development of this package was supported by NIH grants AG053983 and AG057707,
    and by the UCSD Altman Translational Research Institute, NIH grant UL1TR001442.
