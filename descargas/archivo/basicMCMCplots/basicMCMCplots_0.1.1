Description: Provides a function for examining posterior MCMC samples
    from a single chain using trace plots and density plots, and from
    multiple chains by comparing posterior medians and credible intervals
    from each chain.  These plotting functions have a variety of options,
    such as figure sizes, legends, parameters to plot, and saving plots to file.
    Functions interface with the NIMBLE software package, see
