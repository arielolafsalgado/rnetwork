Description: The MCC-F1 analysis is a method to evaluate the performance of binary classifications. 
    The MCC-F1 curve is more reliable than the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and the Precision-Recall (PR)curve under imbalanced ground truth.
    The MCC-F1 analysis also provides the MCC-F1 metric that integrates classifier performance over varying thresholds, and the best threshold of binary classification.
