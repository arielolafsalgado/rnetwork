Description: Create minimal, responsive, and style-agnostic HTML documents with
    the lightweight CSS frameworks such as 'sakura', 'Water.css', and 'mini.css'.
    Powerful features include floating table of contents as a sidebar,
    code folding of source, output, message, warning, and error, and accordion
    menus. They work without JavaScript.
