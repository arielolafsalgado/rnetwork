Description: Provides neutral landscape models 
    (Gardner et al. 1987 <doi:10.1007/BF02275262>,
    With 1997 <doi:10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96210.x>) that can easily extend in 
    existing landscape analyses. Neutral landscape models range from "hard" 
    neutral models (only random functions) to "soft" ones (with parameters) and 
    generate landscape patterns that are not grounded in ecological reasoning.
    Thus, these patterns can be used as null models in landscape ecology. 'NLMR' 
    combines a large number of algorithms from published software (Saura & 
    Martínez 2000   <doi:10.1023/A:1008107902848>, Etherington et
    al. 2015 <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12308>) for simulating neutral landscapes and
    includes utility functions to classify and combine the landscapes. The 
    simulation results are obtained in a geospatial data format (raster* objects 
    from the 'raster' package) and can, therefore, be used 
    in any sort of raster data operation that is performed with standard 
    observation data.
