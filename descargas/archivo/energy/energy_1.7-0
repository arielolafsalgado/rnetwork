Title: E-Statistics: Multivariate Inference via the Energy of Data
Version: 1.7-0
Date: 2016-08-25
Author: Maria L. Rizzo and Gabor J. Szekely
Description: E-statistics (energy) tests and statistics for multivariate and univariate inference,
             including distance correlation, one-sample, two-sample, and multi-sample tests for
             comparing multivariate distributions, are implemented. Measuring and testing
             multivariate independence based on distance correlation, partial distance correlation,
             multivariate goodness-of-fit tests, clustering based on energy distance, testing for
             multivariate normality, distance components (disco) for non-parametric analysis of
             structured data, and other energy statistics/methods are implemented.
