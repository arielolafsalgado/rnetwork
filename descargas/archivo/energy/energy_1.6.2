Description: E-statistics (energy) tests and statistics for comparing
        distributions: multivariate normality, multivariate distance
        components and k-sample test for equal distributions,
        hierarchical clustering by e-distances, multivariate
        independence tests, distance correlation, goodness-of-fit
        tests. Energy- statistics concept based on a generalization of
        Newton's potential energy is due to Gabor J. Szekely.
