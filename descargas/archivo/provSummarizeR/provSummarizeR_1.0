Description: Reads the provenance collected by the 'rdt' or
    'rdtLite' packages, or other tools providing compatible PROV JSON output
    created by the execution of a script, and provides a human-readable 
    summary identifying the input and output files, the script used 
    (if any), errors and warnings produced, and the environment in 
    which it was executed.  It can also optionally package all the 
    files into a zip file.  The exact format of the JSON created by 
    'rdt' and 'rdtLite' is described in 
    <https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/ExtendedProvJson>.  
    More information about 'rdtLite' and associated tools is available 
    at <https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/> and Barbara Lerner, 
    Emery Boose, and Luis Perez (2018), Using Introspection to Collect 
    Provenance in R, Informatics, <doi: 10.3390/informatics5010012>.
