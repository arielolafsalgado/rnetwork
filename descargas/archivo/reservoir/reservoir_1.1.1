Description: Measure single-storage water supply system performance using resilience,
    reliability, and vulnerability metrics; assess storage-yield-reliability
    relationships; determine no-fail storage with sequent peak analysis; optimize
    release decisions for water supply, hydropower, and multi-objective reservoirs
    using deterministic and stochastic dynamic programming; evaluate inflow
    persistence using the Hurst coefficient.
