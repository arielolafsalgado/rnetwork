Title: Extract Equations from a Nomogram
Version: 2.0
Author: Zhicheng Du, Yuantao Hao
Maintainer: Zhicheng Du<dgdzc@hotmail.com>
Description: 
  A nomogram can not be easily applied,
    because it is difficult to calculate the points or even the survival probability.
  The package, including a function of nomogramEx(),
    is to extract the polynomial equations to calculate the points of each variable,
    and the survival probability corresponding to the total points.
