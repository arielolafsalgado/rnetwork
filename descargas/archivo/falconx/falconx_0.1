Title: Finding Allele-Specific Copy Number in Whole-Exome Sequencing
        Data

Description: This is a method for Allele-specific DNA Copy Number profiling for whole-Exome sequencing data.  Given the allele-specific coverage and site biases at the variant loci, this program segments the genome into regions of homogeneous allele-specific copy number.  It requires, as input, the read counts for each variant allele in a pair of case and control samples, as well as the site biases. For detection of somatic mutations, the case and control samples can be the tumor and normal sample from the same individual.
