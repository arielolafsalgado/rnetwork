Description: Provides functions to create factor variables with contrasts based on weighted effect coding, and their interactions. In weighted effect coding the estimates from a first order regression model show the deviations per group from the sample mean. This is especially useful when a researcher has no directional hypotheses and uses a sample from a population in which the number of observation per group is different.
