Description: Performs 'classical' age-depth modelling of dated sediment deposits - prior to applying more sophisticated techniques such as Bayesian age-depth modelling. Any radiocarbon dated depths are calibrated. Age-depth models are constructed by sampling repeatedly from the dated levels, each time drawing age-depth curves. Model types include linear interpolation, linear or polynomial regression, and a range of splines. See Blaauw (2010). <doi:10.1016/j.quageo.2010.01.002>.
