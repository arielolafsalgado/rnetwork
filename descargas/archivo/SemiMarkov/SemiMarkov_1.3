Description: Functions for fitting multi-state semi-Markov models to longitudinal data. A parametric maximum likelihood estimation method adapted to deal with Exponential, Weibull and Exponentiated Weibull distributions is considered. Right-censoring can be taken into account and both constant and time-varying covariates can be included using a Cox proportional model.
