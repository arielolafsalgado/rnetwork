Description: A central decision in a parametric regression is how to specify the relation between an dependent variable and each explanatory variable. This package provides a semi-parametric tool for comparing different transformations of an  explanatory variables in a parametric regression. The functions is relevant in a situation, where you would use a box-cox or Box-Tidwell transformations.  In contrast to the classic power-transformations, the methods in this package allows for  theoretical driven user input and the possibility to compare with a non-parametric transformation.
