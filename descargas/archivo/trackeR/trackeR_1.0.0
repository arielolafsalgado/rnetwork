Description: The aim of this package is to provide infrastructure for handling running and cycling
    data from GPS-enabled tracking devices. After extraction and appropriate
    manipulation of the training or competition attributes, the data are placed
    into session-based and unit-aware data objects of class 'trackeRdata' (S3 class). The
    information in the resulting data objects can then be visualised, summarised,
    and analysed through corresponding flexible and extensible methods.
