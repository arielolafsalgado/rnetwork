Package: coroICA
Title: Confounding Robust Independent Component Analysis for Noisy and
        Grouped Data
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Niklas Pfister and Sebastian Weichwald
Maintainer: Niklas Pfister <pfister@stat.math.ethz.ch>
Description: Contains an implementation of a confounding robust independent component analysis (ICA) for noisy and grouped data. The main function coroICA() performs a blind source separation, by maximizing an independence across sources and allows to adjust for varying confounding based on user-specified groups. Additionally, the package contains the function uwedge() which can be used to approximately jointly diagonalize a list of matrices.
