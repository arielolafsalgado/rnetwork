Description: Efficient design matrix free procedure for penalized estimation
    in large scale 2 and 3-dimensional generalized linear array models. Currently
    either Lasso or SCAD penalized estimation is possible for the followings models:
    The Gaussian model with identity link, the Binomial model with logit link, the
    Poisson model with log link and the Gamma model with log link.
