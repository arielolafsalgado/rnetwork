Description: Efficient design matrix free procedure for penalized estimation in large scale 2 and 3-dimensional generalized linear array models. Currently either Lasso or SCAD penalized estimation is possible for the followings models: The Gaussian model with identity link, the Binomial model with logit link, the Poisson model with log link and the Gamma model with log link.
