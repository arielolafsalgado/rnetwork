Description: Calculates exact critical values to perform continuous or group sequential analysis for Poisson type data using the Maximized Sequential Probability Ratio Test (MaxSPRT) with a Wald type rejection boundary. Also calculates properties such as statistical power, expected time to signal when the null is rejected and maximum sample size needed to obtain a certain power.
