Description: The R Sequential package is designed for performing exact sequential analysis. There are functions to calculate exact critical values, statistical power, expected time to signal and required sample sizes. These calculations can be done for either Poisson or binomial data, for continuous or group sequential analyses, and for different types of rejection boundaries. For group sequential analyses, the group sizes do not have to be specified in advance and, for binomial data, the alpha spending can be arbitrarely settled.
