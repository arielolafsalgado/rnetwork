Description: Functions to calculate exact critical values, statistical power, expected time to				signal and required  sample sizes for  performing exact sequential  analysis. All these				calculations can be done for either Poisson or binomial data, for continuous  or group				sequential analyses, and for different types of rejection boundaries.  In case  of group				sequential  analyses, the group  sizes do not  have to be specified in advance and,  for				binomial data, the alpha spending can be arbitrarily settled.
