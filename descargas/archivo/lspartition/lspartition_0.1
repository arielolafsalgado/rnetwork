Description: Tools for statistical analysis using partitioning-based least squares regression as described in Cattaneo, Farrell and Feng (2018) <arXiv:1804.04916>. lsprobust() for nonparametric point estimation of regression functions and derivatives thereof, and for robust bias-corrected (pointwise and uniform) inference procedures. lspkselect() for data-driven procedure for selecting the IMSE-optimal number of knots. lsprobust.plot() for regression plots with robust confidence intervals and confidence bands. lsplincom() for estimation and inference for linear combinations of regression functions from different groups.
