Description: Perform nonparametric Bayesian analysis using Dirichlet 
    processes without the need to program the inference algorithms. 
    Utilise included pre-built models or specify custom 
    models and allow the 'dirichletprocess' package to handle the 
    Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. 
    Our Dirichlet process objects can act as building blocks for a variety 
    of statistical models including and not limited to: density estimation, 
    clustering and prior distributions in hierarchical models.
