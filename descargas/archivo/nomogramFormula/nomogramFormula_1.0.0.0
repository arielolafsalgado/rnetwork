Title: Calculate Total Points and Probabilities for Nomogram
Version: 1.0.0.0
Description: 
  A nomogram, which can be carried out in 'rms' package, provides a 
    graphical explanation of a prediction process. However, it is not very easy
    to draw straight lines, read points and probabilities accurately. Even, it 
    is hard for users to calculate total points and probabilities for all 
    subjects.
  This package provides formula_rd() and formula_lp() functions to fit the 
    formula of total points with raw data and linear predictors respectively by
    polynomial regression. Function points_cal() will help you calculate the 
    total points. formula_prob() and prob_cal() can be used to fit the formula of 
    probabilities and total points and calculate the probabilities.
