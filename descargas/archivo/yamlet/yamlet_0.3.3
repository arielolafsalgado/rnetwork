Package: yamlet
Type: Package
Title: Versatile Curation of Table Metadata
Version: 0.3.3
Author: Tim Bergsma
Maintainer: Tim Bergsma <bergsmat@gmail.com>
Description: The 'yamlet' package implements a file-based
 mechanism for documenting datasets. It reads and writes
 YAML-formatted metadata and applies it as data 
 item attributes. Data and metadata are stored independently
 but can be coordinated by using similar file paths with
 different extensions.  The 'yamlet' dialect is valid 'YAML',
 but some conventions are chosen to improve readability. 
 Defaults and conventions can be over-ridden by the user. 
 See ?yamlet and ?decorate.data.frame.
 See ?read_yamlet ?write_yamlet, and ?io_csv.
