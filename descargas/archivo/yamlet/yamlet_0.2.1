Title: Store Data Specification as YAML
Version: 0.2.1
Author: Tim Bergsma
Maintainer: Tim Bergsma <bergsmat@gmail.com>
Description: A data specification is useful both for 
 developing and documenting data.  The 'yamlet' package 
 reads YAML-formatted metadata and applies it as data 
 item attributes. Data and metadata are stored independently
 and optionally associated by naming conventions.  For 
 compact representation, keys label and guide are assigned 
 by default to the first two anonymous values for  each 
 named item. Defaults can be over-ridden by stored metadata
 or by function arguments. See package?yamlet and 
 ?decorate.data.frame.
