Description: Computes matching algorithms efficiently using Rcpp.
    Implements the Gale-Shapley Algorithm to compute the stable matching for
    two-sided markets, such as the stable marriage problem and the
    college-admissions problem. Implements Irving's Algorithm for
    the stable roommate problem. Implements the top trading cycle
    algorithm for the indivisible goods trading problem.
