Description: This package contains functions and utilities to perform
        Statistical Analyses in the Six Sigma way.  Through the DMAIC
        cycle (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control), you can
        manage several Quality Management studies: Gage R&R, Capability
        Analysis, Control Charts, Loss Function Analysis, etc. Data
        frames used in the book "Six Sigma with R" (Springer, 2012) are
        also included in the package.
