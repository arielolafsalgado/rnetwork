Description: An implementation of the MRS algorithm for comparison across distributions,
  as described in Jacopo Soriano, Li Ma (2016) <doi:10.1111/rssb.12180>. 
  The model is based on a nonparametric process taking the form of a Markov model 
  that transitions between a "null" and an "alternative" state 
  on a multi-resolution partition tree of the sample space. 
  MRS effectively detects and characterizes a variety of underlying differences. 
  These differences can be visualized using several plotting functions.
