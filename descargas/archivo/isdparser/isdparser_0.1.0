Description: Tools for parsing 'NOAA' Integrated Surface Data ('ISD') files,
    described at <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd>. Data includes for example,
    wind speed and direction, temperature, cloud data, sea level pressure,
    and more. Includes data from approximately 35,000 stations worldwide,
