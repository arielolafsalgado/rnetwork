Description: 
  Provides a common interface for applying dimensionality reduction methods,
  such as Principal Component Analysis ('PCA'), Independent Component Analysis ('ICA'), diffusion maps, 
  Locally-Linear Embedding ('LLE'), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding ('t-SNE'), 
  and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection ('UMAP'). 
  Has built-in support for sparse matrices.
