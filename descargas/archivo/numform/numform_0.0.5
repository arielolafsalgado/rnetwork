Description: Format numbers for publication; includes the removal of leading zeros, standardization of number of digits, addition of affixes, and a p-value
                  formatter. These tools combine the functionality of several 'base' functions such as paste(), format(), and sprintf() into specific use case
                  functions that are named in a way that is consistent with usage, making their names easy to remember and easy to deploy.
