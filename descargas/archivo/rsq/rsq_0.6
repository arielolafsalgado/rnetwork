Description: Calculates a newly defined coefficient of determination, aka R^2, and coefficient of partial determination, aka partial R^2 by Zhang (2016) for generalized linear models (including quasi models with well defined variance functions). It also avoids overstatement of variation proportion explained by the model or a group of covariates.
