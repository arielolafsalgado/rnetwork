Description: The xlsxjars package collects all the external jars
  required for the xlxs package.  These external jars are quite large
  in size (15MB) and have a slow release cycle.  By separating the
  Java and R development, the storage footprint on CRAN is reduced.
  This release corresponds to POI 3.10.
