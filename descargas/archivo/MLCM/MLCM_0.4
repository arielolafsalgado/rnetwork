Description: Conjoint measurement is a psychophysical procedure in which stimulus pairs are presented that vary along 2 or more dimensions and the observer is required to compare the stimuli along one of them.  This package contains functions to estimate the contribution of the n scales to the judgment by a maximum likelihood method under several hypotheses of how the perceptual dimensions interact.
