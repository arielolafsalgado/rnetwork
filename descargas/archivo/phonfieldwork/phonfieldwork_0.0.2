Description: There are a lot of different typical tasks that should be solved during phonetic research and experiments, such as creation of presentation that will contain all stimuli, rename and concatenate multiple sound files recorded during phonetic session, automatically annotate 'Praat' TextGrids (this is one of the sound annotation standards provided by 'Praat' software, see Paul Boersma, David Weenink 2018 <http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/>), create an html that includes annotation and spectrogram tables, convert multiple formats ('Praat' TextGrid, 'EXMARaLDA' and 'ELAN') into each other. All those tasks could be solved by mixture of different tools (some programs in any programming language for automatic renaming, some Praat scripts for the file concatenation and renaming, etc). This package provides functionality that will make it easier to solve those tasks independently of any of tools. You could also compare the functionality with other packages: 'rPraat' <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPraat>, 'textgRid' <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=textgRid>.
