Description: There are a lot of different typical tasks that have to be solved during phonetic research and experiments. This includes creating a presentation that will contain all stimuli, renaming and concatenating multiple sound files recorded during a session, automatic annotation in 'Praat' TextGrids (this is one of the sound annotation standards provided by 'Praat' software, see Boersma & Weenink 2018 <http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/>), creating an html table with annotations and spectrograms, and converting multiple formats ('Praat' TextGrid, 'EXMARaLDA' and 'ELAN'). All of these tasks can be solved by a mixture of different tools (any programming language has programs for automatic renaming, and Praat contains scripts for concatenating and renaming files, etc.). `phonfieldwork` provides a functionality that will make it easier to solve those tasks independently of any additional tools. You can also compare the functionality with other packages: 'rPraat' <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rPraat>, 'textgRid' <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=textgRid>.
