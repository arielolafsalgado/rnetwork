Description: Infrastructure for psychometric modeling such as data classes
  (for item response data and paired comparisons), basic model fitting
  functions (for Bradley-Terry, Rasch, partial credit, rating scale,
  multinomial processing tree models), extractor functions for different types
  of parameters (item, person, threshold, discrimination), unified inference
  and visualizations, and various datasets for illustration. Intended as a
  common lightweight and efficient toolbox for psychometric modeling and a
  common building block for fitting psychometric mixture models in package
  "psychomix" and trees based on psychometric models in package "psychotree".
