Description: Provides a fast and parallelised calculator to estimate combined wastewater emissions. 
    It supports the planning and design of urban drainage systems, without the requirement of 
    extensive simulation tools. The 'EmiStatR' package implements modular R methods. This enables 
    to add new functionalities through the R framework. Furthermore, 'EmiStatR' was implemented 
    with an interactive user interface with sliders and input data exploration.
