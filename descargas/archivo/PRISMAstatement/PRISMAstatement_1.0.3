Description: Plot a PRISMA <http://prisma-statement.org/> flow
    chart describing the identification, screening, eligibility and
    inclusion or studies in systematic reviews. PRISMA is an
    evidence-based minimum set of items for reporting in systematic
    reviews and meta-analyses. PRISMA focuses on the reporting of reviews
    evaluating randomized trials, but can also be used as a basis for
    reporting systematic reviews of other types of research, particularly
    evaluations of interventions.
