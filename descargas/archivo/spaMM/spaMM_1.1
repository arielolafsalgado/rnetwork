Description: Implements a collection of functions for inference in 
  hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLMs), which include GLMMs but also non-Gaussian random effects (e.g. Beta Binomial). 
  It was developed in particular for GLMMs with spatial correlations.
  Heteroskedasticity can further be fitted by a linear model.
  The algorithms are currently various Laplace approximations methods for ML or REML, 
  in particular h-likelihood and penalized-likelihood methods.
