Description: Inference in mixed-effect models, including generalized linear mixed models with spatial
    correlations and models with non-Gaussian random effects (e.g., Beta Binomial,
    or negative-binomial mixed models). Variation in residual variance is handled and can be modelled
    as a linear model. The algorithms are currently various Laplace approximations
    methods for likelihood or restricted likelihood, in particular h-likelihood and penalized-likelihood
    methods.
