Description: A collection of functions for inferences in hierarchical generalized linear models (HGLMs), 
  and in particular for GLMMs with spatially correlated random effects. 
  Currently implements several variants of Laplace approximations methods for approximation of the likelihood 
  or restricted likelihood, in particular h-likelihood and penalized-likelihood methods.
