Version: 0.1.2
Author: Patrick O'Keefe
Maintainer: Patrick O'Keefe <patrick.okeefe@vanderbilt.edu>
Description: Primarily devoted to implementing the Univariate Bootstrap (as well as the Traditional Bootstrap). In addition there are multiple functions for DeFries-Fulker behavioral genetics models. The univariate bootstrapping functions, DeFries-Fulker functions, regression and traditional bootstrapping functions form the original core. Additional features may come online later, however this software is a work in progress. For more information about univariate bootstrapping see: Lee and Rodgers (1998) and Beasley et al (2007) <doi.org/10.1037/1082-989X.12.4.414>.
