Description: This package contains a Gibbs sampler to sample from the posterior distribution of the negative binomial mixed-effect regression model. For the distribution of subject-specific random intercept, user can choose a beta distribution or an infinite mixture of beta distributions. For the safety monitoring, subject-specific conditional probability indices can be computed.  For details, see Kondo,Y., Zhao, Y. and Petkau, J.A.
