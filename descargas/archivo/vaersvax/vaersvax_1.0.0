Description: US VAERS vaccine data for 01/01/2016 - 03/14/2016. If you want to
    explore the full VAERS data for 1990 - Present (data, symptoms, and
    vaccines), then check out the 'vaers' package from the URL below. The URL
    and BugReports below correspond to the 'vaers' package, of which 'vaersvax'
    is a small subset (2016 only). 'vaers' is not hosted on CRAN due to the
    large size of the data set. "VAERS is a national vaccine safety
    surveillance program co-sponsored by the US Centers for Disease Control and
    Prevention (CDC) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). VAERS is a
    post-marketing safety surveillance program, collecting information about
    adverse events (possible side effects) that occur after the administration
    of vaccines licensed for use in the United States." For more information
    about the data, visit https://vaers.hhs.gov/index. For information about
    vaccination/immunization hazards, visit
