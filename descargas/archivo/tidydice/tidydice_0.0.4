Version: 0.0.4
Author: Roland Krasser
Maintainer: Roland Krasser <roland.krasser@gmail.com>
Description: Utils for basic statistical experiments, that can be used for teaching 
    introductory statistics. Each experiment generates a tibble.
    Dice rolls and coin flips are simulated using sample().
    The properties of the dice can be changed, like the number of sides.
    A coin flip is simulated using a two sided dice.
    Experiments can be combined with the pipe-operator.
