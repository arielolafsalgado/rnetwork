Description: It is a computer tool to conduct mediation analysis for complex surveys using multi-stage sampling. Specifically, the mediation analysis method using balanced repeated replication was proposed by Mai, Ha, and Soulakova (2019) <DOI:10.1080/10705511.2018.1559065>. The development of 'MedSurvey' was sponsored by American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC). However, the contents of MedSurvey do not necessarily represent the policy of the ALSAC.
