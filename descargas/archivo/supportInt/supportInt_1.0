Description: Calculates likelihood based support intervals for
    several common data types including binomial, Poisson, normal, lm(), and
    glm(). For the binomial, Poisson, and normal data likelihood intervals are
    calculated via root finding algorithm. Additional parameters allow the
    user to specify whether they would like to receive a parametric bootstrap
    estimate of the confidence level of said support interval. For lm() and glm(),
    the function returns profile likelihoods for each coefficient in the model.
