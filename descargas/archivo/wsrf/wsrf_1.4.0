Description: The wsrf package is a parallel implementation of the
	Weighted Subspace Random Forest algorithm proposed (wsrf).  A
	novel variable weighting method is used for variable subspace
	selection in place of the traditional approach of random
	variable sampling.  This new approach is particularly useful
	in building models for high dimensional data---often
	consisting of thousands of variables.  Parallel computation is
	used to take advantage of multi-core machines and clusters of
	machines to build random forest models from high dimensional
	data with reduced elapsed times.
