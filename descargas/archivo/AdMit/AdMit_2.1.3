Description: Provides functions to perform the fitting of an adaptive mixture
    of Student-t distributions to a target density through its kernel function as described in
    Ardia et al. (2009) <doi:10.18637/jss.v029.i03>. The
    mixture approximation can then be used as the importance density in importance
    sampling or as the candidate density in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to
    obtain quantities of interest for the target density itself.
