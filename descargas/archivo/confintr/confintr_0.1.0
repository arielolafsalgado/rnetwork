Description: Calculates classic and/or bootstrap confidence
    intervals for many parameters such as the population mean, variance,
    interquartile range (IQR), median absolute deviation (MAD), skewness,
    kurtosis, Cramer's V, R-squared, quantiles (incl. median),
    proportions, different types of correlation measures, difference in
    means, quantiles and medians. Many of the classic confidence intervals
    are described in Smithson, M. (2003, ISBN: 978-0761924999). Bootstrap
    confidence intervals are calculated with the R package 'boot'. Both
    one- and two-sided intervals are supported.
