Description: Manhattan plot, a type of scatter plot, was widely used to display the association results. However, it is usually time-consuming and laborious for a
 non-specialist user to write scripts and adjust parameters of an elaborate plot. Moreover, the ever-growing traits measured have necessitated the 
 integration of results from different Genome-wide association study researches. Circle Manhattan Plot is the first open R package that can lay out 
 Genome-wide association study P-value results in both traditional rectangular patterns and novel circular ones. United in only one bull's eye style 
 plot, association results from multiple traits can be compared interactively, thereby to reveal both similarities and differences between signals.
