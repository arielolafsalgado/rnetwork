Description: SKAT is a kernel regression based association test between a set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and dichotomous or quantitative phenotypes. SKAT aggregates individual score test statistics of SNPs in a SNP set and efficiently computes SNP-set level p-values, while adjusting for covariates, such as principal components to account for population stratification.
