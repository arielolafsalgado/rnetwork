Title: Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation
Description: An implementation of Simultaneous Truth and 
    Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) <doi:10.1109/TMI.2004.828354>.  This
    method is used when there are multiple raters for an object, typically an
    image, and this method fuses these ratings into one rating.  It uses an
    expectation-maximization method to estimate this rating and the individual
    specificity/sensitivity for each rater.
