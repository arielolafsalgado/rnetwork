Description: Computes 46 optimized distance and similarity measures for comparing probability functions (Drost (2018) <doi:10.21105/joss.00765>). These comparisons between probability functions have their foundations in a broad range of scientific disciplines from mathematics to ecology. The aim of this package is to provide a core framework for clustering, classification, statistical inference, goodness-of-fit, non-parametric statistics, information theory, and machine learning tasks that are based on comparing univariate or multivariate probability functions.
