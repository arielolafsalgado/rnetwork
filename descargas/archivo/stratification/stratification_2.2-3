Description: This package performs univariate stratification of survey
        populations. The main function implements a generalization of
        the Lavallee-Hidiroglou method of stratum construction. The
        generalized method takes into account a discrepancy between the
        stratification variable and the survey variable. The
        determination of the optimal boundaries also incorporate, if
        desired, an anticipated non-response, a take-all stratum for
        large units, a take-none stratum for small units, and a
        certainty stratum to ensure that some specific units are in the
        sample. The well known cumulative root frequency rule of
        Dalenius and Hodges and the geometric rule of Gunning and
        Horgan are also implemented.
