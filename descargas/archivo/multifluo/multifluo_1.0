Description: Deals with several images of a same object, constituted of different zones. Each image constitutes a variable for a given pixel. The user can interactively select different zones of an image. Then, multivariate analysis (PCA) can be run in order to characterize the different selected zones, according to the different images. Hotelling (Hotelling, 1931, <doi:10.1214/aoms/1177732979>) and Srivastava (Srivastava, 2009, <doi:10.1016/j.jmva.2006.11.002>) tests can be run to detect multivariate differences between the zones.
