Description: Assess the agreement in method comparison studies by tolerance intervals and errors-in-variables regressions. The Ordinary Least Square regressions (OLSv and OLSh), the Deming Regression (DR), and the (Correlated)-Bivariate Least Square regressions (BLS and CBLS) can be used with unreplicated or replicated data. The BLS and CBLS are the two main functions to estimate a regression line, while XY.plot and MD.plot are the two main graphical functions to display, respectively an (X,Y) plot or (M,D) plot with the BLS or CBLS results. Assuming no proportional bias, the (M,D) plot (Band-Altman plot) may be simplified by calculating horizontal lines intervals with tolerance intervals (beta-expectation (type I) or beta-gamma content (type II)).
