Title: Examine Measurement Invariance via Equivalence Testing and
        Projection Method
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ge Jiang, Yujiao Mai, and Ke-Hai Yuan
Maintainer: Ge Jiang <gjiang2@nd.edu>
Description: Functions for examining measurement invariance via equivalence testing along with adjusted RMSEA(root mean square error of approximation; Steiger & Lind, 1980) cutoff values. In particular, a projection-based method is implemented to test the equality of latent factor means across groups without assuming the equality of intercepts.
