Description: Computes entropy-based segregation indices, as developed by
    Theil (1971) <isbn:978-0471858454>, with a focus on
    the Mutual Information Index (M) and Theil's Information Index (H).
    The M, further described by Mora and Ruiz-Castillo (2011) <doi:10.1111/j.1467-9531.2011.01237.x>
    and Frankel and Volij (2011) <doi:10.1016/j.jet.2010.10.008>,
    is a measure of segregation that is highly decomposable. The package provides
    tools to decompose the index by units and groups (local segregation),
    and by within and between terms.
    Includes standard error estimation by bootstrapping.
