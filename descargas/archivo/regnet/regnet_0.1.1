Title: Network-Based Regularization for Generalized Linear Models
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Jie Ren, Luann C. Jung, Yinhao Du, Cen Wu, Yu Jiang, Junhao Liu

Description: Network-based regularization has achieved success in variable selections for 
    high-dimensional biological data, due to its ability to incorporate the correlations 
    among genomic features. This package provides procedures for fitting network-based 
    regularization, minimax concave penalty (MCP) and lasso penalty for generalized linear 
    models. This first version, regnet0.1.1, focuses on binary outcomes. Functions for 
    continuous, survival outcomes and other regularization methods will be included in the 
    forthcoming upgraded version.
