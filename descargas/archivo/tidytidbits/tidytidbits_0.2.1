Description: A selection of various tools to extend a data analysis workflow based on the 'tidyverse' packages.
  This includes high-level data frame editing methods (in the style of 'mutate'/'mutate_at'), some methods in the style of
  'purrr' and 'forcats', 'lookup' methods for dict-like lists, a generic method for lumping a data frame by a given count,
  various low-level methods for special treatment of 'NA' values, 'python'-style tuple-assignment and 'truthy'/'falsy' checks,
  saving to PDF and PNG from a pipe and various small utilities.
