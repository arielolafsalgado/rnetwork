Description: Lattice functions for drawing folded empirical cumulative distribution plots, or mountain plots. A mountain plot is similar to an empirical CDF plot, except that the curve increases from 0 to 0.5, then decreases from 0.5 to 1 using an inverted scale at the right side.  See: Monti (1995), Folded empirical distribution function curves-mountain plots.  The American Statistician, 49, 342-345.
