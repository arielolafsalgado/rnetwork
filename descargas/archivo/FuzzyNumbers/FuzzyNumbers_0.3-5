Description: The FuzzyNumbers package provides S4 classes and methods
    to deal with fuzzy numbers. With them you can calculate any arithmetic
    operations (e.g. by using the Zadeh extension principle),
    perform approximation of arbitrary FNs by trapezoidal and piecewise
    linear FNs, prepare plots of FNs for publications, etc.
