Description: This package allows to fit  a regression model suitable for data analysis in which the conditional distribution of the response is symmetric and continuous and where its location and dispersion parameters are modelled through semiparametric functions. Supported distributions for the model error include normal, Student-t, power exponential, symmetric hyperbolic, contaminated normal, slash, sinh-normal and sinh-t distributions.
