Description: Algorithms to calculate the hidden inputs of systems of differential equations. 
  These hidden inputs can be interpreted as a control that tries to minimize the
  discrepancies between a given model and taken measurements. The idea is 
  also called the Dynamic Elastic Net, as proposed in the paper "Learning (from) the errors of a systems biology model" 
  (Engelhardt, Froelich, Kschischo 2016) <doi:10.1038/srep20772>.
  To use the experimental SBML import function, the 'rsbml' package is required. For installation I refer to the official 'rsbml' page: <https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rsbml.html>.
