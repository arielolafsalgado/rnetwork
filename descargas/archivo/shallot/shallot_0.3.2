Title: Random Partition Distribution Indexed by Pairwise Information
Version: 0.3.2
Date: 2017-05-24
Description: Implementations are provided for the models described in the paper D. B. Dahl, R. Day, J. Tsai (2017) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2016.1165103>.  The Ewens, Ewens-Pitman, Ewens attraction, Ewens-Pitman attraction, and ddCRP distributions are available for prior simulation.  We hope in the future to add posterior simulation with a user-supplied likelihood.  Supporting functions for partition estimation and plotting are also planned.
