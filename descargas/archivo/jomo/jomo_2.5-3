Description: Similarly to Schafer's package 'pan', 'jomo' is a package for multilevel joint modelling multiple imputation.
 Novel aspects of 'jomo' are the possibility of handling binary and categorical data through latent normal variables, the option to use cluster-specific covariance matrices and to impute compatibly with the substantive model.
