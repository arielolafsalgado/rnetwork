Description: Provides a list of functions for the statistical analysis of archaeological phases. It is based on the post-processing of the Markov Chains whose stationary distribution is the posterior distribution of a series of dates. Such MCMC output can be simulated by different applications as for instance 'ChronoModel' (see <http://www.chronomodel.fr>) or 'Oxcal' (see <https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html>). The only requirement is to have a CSV file containing a sample from the posterior distribution.
