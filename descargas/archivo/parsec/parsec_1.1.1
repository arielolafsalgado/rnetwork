Description: Implements basic partial order tools for multidimensional poverty evaluation with ordinal variables. Its main goal is to provide socio-economic scholars with an integrated set of elementary functions for multidimensional poverty evaluation, based on ordinal information. The package is organized in four main parts. The first two comprise functions for data management and basic partial order analysis; the third and the fourth are devoted to evaluation and implement both the poset-based approach and a more classical counting procedure.
