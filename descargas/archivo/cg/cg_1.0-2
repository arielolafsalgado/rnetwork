Description: cg is comprehensive data analysis software, and stands for "compare groups." Its genesis and evolution are driven by common needs to compare administrations, conditions, etc. in medicine research &  development. The current version provides comparisons of unpaired samples, i.e. a linear model with one factor of at least two levels. It also provides comparisons of two paired samples. Good data graphs, modern statistical methods, and useful displays of results are emphasized.
