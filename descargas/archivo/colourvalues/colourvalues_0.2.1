Description: Maps one of the viridis colour palettes, or a user-specified palette to values. 
    Viridis colour maps are created by St√©fan van der Walt and Nathaniel Smith. 
    They were set as the default palette for the 'Python' 'Matplotlib' library, 
    introduced at SciPy 2015 conference <http://scipy2015.scipy.org/ehome/index.php?eventid=115969&>. 
    Other palettes available in this library have been derived from 
    'RColorBrewer' <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RColorBrewer> and 
    'colorspace' <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=colorspace> packages.
