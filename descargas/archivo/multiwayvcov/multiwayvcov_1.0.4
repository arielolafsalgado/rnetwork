Description: This package exports one function cluster.vcov, which implements
    multi-way clustering using the method suggested by Cameron, Gelbach, &
    Miller (2011).  Normal one and two-way clustering matches the results of
    other common statistical packages.  Missing values are handled
    transparently and rudimentary parallelization support is provided.
