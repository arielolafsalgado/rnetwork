Description: Provides an interface to the National Topographic System (NTS), which is
 the way in which a number of freely available Canadian datasets 
 are organized. CanVec and CanVec+ datasets, which include all data used
 to create Canadian topographic maps, are two such datasets that are useful
 in creating vector-based maps for locations across Canada. This packages searches
 CanVec data by location, plots it using pretty defaults, and exports it to
 human-readable shapefiles for use in another GIS.
