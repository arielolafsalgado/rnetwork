Description: Provides an interface to the National Topographic System (NTS),
    which is the way in which a number of freely available Canadian datasets are
    organized. CanVec and CanVec+ datasets, which include all data used to create
    Canadian topographic maps, are two such datasets that are useful in creating
    vector-based maps for locations across Canada. This packages searches CanVec
    data by location, plots it using pretty defaults, and exports it to human-
    readable shapefiles for use in another GIS.
