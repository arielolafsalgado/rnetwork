Description: At present, the only functionality is the calculation of optimal one-sided winsorizing cutoffs. The main function is optimal.onesided.cutoff.bygroup. It calculates the optimal tuning parameter for one-sided winsorisation, and so calculates winsorised values for a variable of interest. See the help file for this function for more details and an example.
