Description: Provides ANOCVA (ANalysis Of Cluster VAriability), a non-parametric statistical test
    to compare clustering structures with applications in functional magnetic resonance imaging
    data (fMRI). The ANOCVA allows us to compare the clustering structure of multiple groups
    simultaneously and also to identify features that contribute to the differential clustering.
