    Shewhart control charts in order to increase the sensitivity of detecting
    assignable causes of process change. This package implements eight commonly
    used WECO rules and allow to apply the combination of these individual rules
    for detecting the deviation from a stable process. The package also provides
    a web-based graphical user interface to help users conduct the analysis.
