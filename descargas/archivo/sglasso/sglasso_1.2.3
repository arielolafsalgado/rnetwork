Description: RCON(V, E) models are a kind of restriction of the Gaussian Graphical Models defined by a set of equality constraints on the entries of the concentration matrix. 'sglasso' package implements the structured graphical lasso (sglasso) estimator proposed in Abbruzzo et al. (2014) for the weighted l1-penalized RCON(V, E) model. Two cyclic coordinate algorithms are implemented to compute the sglasso estimator, i.e. a cyclic coordinate minimization (CCM) and a cyclic coordinate descent (CCD) algorithm.
