Title: Detect Heatwaves and Cold-Spells
Description: The different methods of defining and detecting extreme events, known as heatwaves or cold-spells in both air and water temperature data are encompassed within this package. These detection algorithms may be used on non-temperature data as well however, this is not catered for explicitly here as no use of this technique in the literature currently exists.
