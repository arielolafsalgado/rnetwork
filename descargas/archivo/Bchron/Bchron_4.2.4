Description: Enables quick calibration of radiocarbon dates under various calibration curves (including user generated ones); Age-depth modelling as per the algorithm of Haslett and Parnell (2008); Relative sea level rate estimation incorporating time uncertainty in polynomial regression models; and non-parametric phase modelling via Gaussian mixtures as a means to determine the activity of a site (and as an alternative to the Oxcal function SUM). The package includes a vignette which can be accessed via the vignette.
