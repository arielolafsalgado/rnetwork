Description: Enables quick calibration of radiocarbon dates under various
    calibration curves (including user generated ones); Age-depth modelling as
    per the algorithm of Haslett and Parnell (2008) <DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2008.00623.x>; Relative sea level rate
    estimation incorporating time uncertainty in polynomial regression models; and
    non-parametric phase modelling via Gaussian mixtures as a means to determine
    the activity of a site (and as an alternative to the Oxcal function SUM). The
    package includes a vignette which explains most of the basic functionality.
