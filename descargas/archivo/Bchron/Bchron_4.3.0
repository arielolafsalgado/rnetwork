Description: Enables quick calibration of radiocarbon dates under various 
  calibration curves (including user generated ones); age-depth modelling 
  as per the algorithm of Haslett and Parnell (2008) <DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9876.2008.00623.x>; Relative sea level 
  rate estimation incorporating time uncertainty in polynomial regression 
  models (Parnell and Gehrels 2015) <DOI:10.1002/9781118452547.ch32>; non-parametric phase modelling via 
  Gaussian mixtures as a means to determine the activity of a site 
  (and as an alternative to the Oxcal function SUM; currently 
  unpublished), and reverse calibration of dates from calibrated into 
  un-calibrated years (also unpublished).
