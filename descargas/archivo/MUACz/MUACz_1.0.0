Description: Generates mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) for age z-scores for children and
              adolescents aged 5 to 19 years that can be used to assess nutritional and 
              health status and  define risk of adverse health events. 
              The standard growth reference constructed by Mramba et. al (2017) 
              (<doi:10.1136/bmj.j3423>) smoothly join the WHO (2005) standards at age 5 years 
              (<https://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/Technical_report.pdf>) 
              and has been validated against mortality risk among children 
              and adolescents in Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe.
