Description: simecol is an object oriented framework to simulate
        ecological (and other) dynamic systems. It can be used for
        differential equations, individual-based (or agent-based) and
        other models as well. The package helps to organize scenarios
        (avoids copy and paste) and improves readability and usability
        of code.
