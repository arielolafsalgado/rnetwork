Description: Contains a number of functions that serve
    two goals. First, to make R more accessible to people migrating
    from SPSS by adding a number of functions that behave roughly like
    their SPSS equivalents (also see <http://rosettastats.com>). Second,
    to make a number of slightly more advanced functions more user
    friendly to relatively novice users. The package also conveniently
    houses a number of additional functions that are intended to
    increase the quality of methodology and statistics in psychology,
    not by offering technical solutions, but by shifting perspectives,
    for example towards reasoning based on sampling distributions as
    opposed to on point estimates.
