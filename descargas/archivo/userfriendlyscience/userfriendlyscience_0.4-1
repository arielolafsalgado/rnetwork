Description: Contains a number of functions that serve
  two goals: first, make R more accessible to people migrating from
  SPSS by adding a number of functions that behave roughly like their
  SPSS equivalents; and second, make a number of slightly more
  advanced functions more user friendly to relatively novice users.
