Description: A simulation-based tool made to help researchers to become familiar with
    multilevel variations, and to build up sampling designs for their study. 
    This tool has two main objectives: First, it provides an educational tool useful for students, 
    teachers and researchers who want to learn to use mixed-effects models. 
    Users can experience how the mixed-effects model framework can be used to understand 
    distinct biological phenomena by interactively exploring simulated multilevel data. 
    Second, it offers research opportunities to those who are already familiar with 
    mixed-effects models, as it enables the generation of data sets that users may download 
    and use for a range of simulation-based statistical analyses such as power 
    and sensitivity analysis of multilevel and multivariate data.
