Package: longurl
Title: Expand Short URLs
Version: 0.3.0
Authors@R: c(person("Bob", "Rudis", email = "bob@rud.is", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: Tools expand vectors of short URLs into long URLs. No API services are used,
    which may mean that this operates more slowly than API services do (since they usually
    cache results of expansions every user of the service performs).
