Title: Wizardry Code Offensive Programming
Version: 1.1.15
Author: Fabien Gelineau <neonira@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Fabien Gelineau <neonira@gmail.com>
Description: Allows to change R coding from defensive programming (i.e. many input
    parameter checks implementation required) to offensive
    programming (none/reduced number of parameter checks required). Provides code 
    instrumentation to ease this change. Should reduce
    the code size as many controls and type checks have no more reason to exist.
    Should also speed up processing as many checks will be reduced to single check.
