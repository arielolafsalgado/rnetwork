Title: Inferring the Topology of Omics Data
Version: 1.0.0

Description: Infers a topology of relationships between different datasets, such as multi-omics and phenotypic data recorded on the same samples. We based this methodology on the RV coefficient (Robert & Escoufier, 1976, <doi:10.2307/2347233>), a measure of matrix correlation, which we have extended for partial matrix correlations and binary data (Aben et al., 2018, in preparation).
