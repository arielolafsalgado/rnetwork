        Panel Data

Description: Sparse modeling provides a mean selecting a small number of non-zero effects from a large possible number of candidate effects.  This package includes a suite of methods for sparse modeling.  Beyond regression analyses, applications include subgroup analysis, particularly for conjoint experiments, and panel data.  Functionality for dichotomous and censored outcome (Types I and II tobit) is also included.  Future plans involve extending the method to propensity score and instrumental variable methods.
