Description: This package contains two main interfaces for fitting and
        diagnosing bent-cable regressions for autoregressive
        time-series data or independent data (time series or
        otherwise). The interfaces are 'bentcable.ar()' and
        'bentcable.dev.plot()'. Some components in the package can also
        be used as stand-alone functions. The bent cable
        (linear-quadratic-linear) generalizes the broken stick
        (linear-linear), which is also handled by this package. Version
        0.2 corrects a glitch in the computation of confidence
        intervals for the CTP. References updated from Versions 0.2.1
        and 0.2.2 appear in Version 0.2.3.
