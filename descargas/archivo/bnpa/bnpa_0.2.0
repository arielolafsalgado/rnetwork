Description: We proposed a hybrid approach using the computational and statistical  resources 
    of the Bayesian Networks to learn a network structure from a data set using 4 different 
    algorithms and the robustness of the statistical methods present in the Structural Equation
    Modeling to check the goodness of fit from model over data. We built an intermediate 
    algorithm to join the features of 'bnlearn' and 'lavaan' R packages. The Bayesian Networks
    structure learning algorithms used were 'Hill-Climbing', 'Max-Min Hill-Climbing', 'Restricted 
    Maximization' and 'Tabu Search'.
