Description: Perform population assignment using a machine learning framework. It employs supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the discriminatory power of your known data set, and is capable of analyzing large genetic, non-genetic, or integrated (genetic plus non-genetic) data sets. This framework is also designed for solving the upwardly biased issue that was discussed in previous studies.
