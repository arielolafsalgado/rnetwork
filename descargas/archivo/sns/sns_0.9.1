Description: Multivariate, Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler for twice differentiable, log-concave probability densities. SNS is a Metropolis-Hastings variant, where the proposal function is a local Gaussian approximation to the density obtained via a second order Taylor expansion around the current point. The mean of the Gaussian proposal is taken as the full Newton-Raphson step from the current point. During burn-in, Newton-Raphson optimization is performed to get close to the mode of the pdf which is unique due to convexity.
