Description: Fits regularization paths for linear regression, GLM, and Cox
  regression models using lasso or nonconvex penalties, in particular the
  minimax concave penalty (MCP) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD)
  penalty, with options for additional L2 penalties (the "elastic net" idea).
  Utilities for carrying out cross-validation as well as post-fitting
  visualization, summarization, inference, and prediction are also provided.
