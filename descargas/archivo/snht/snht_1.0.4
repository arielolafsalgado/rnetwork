Description: Implementation of robust and non-robust Standard Normal Homogeneity
    Test (SNHT) for changepoint detection. This test statistic is equal sided,
    as proposed in "Homogenization of Radiosonde Temperature Time Series Using
    Innovation Statistics" by Haimberger, L., 2007. However, the statistic contains
    an estimate of sigma^2 in the denominator instead of sigma, which seems to
    be a more appropriate value (based on the paper "Homogenization of Swedish
    temperature data. Part I: Homogeneity test for linear trends." by Alexandersson,
    H., and A. Moberg, 1997).
