Description: Developed for the following tasks. Firstly, Computing the probability density function, cumulative 
             distribution function, random generation, and estimating the parameters of the eleven mixture 
             models including mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders, BurrXII, Chen, F, Frechet, gamma, Gompertz,
             log-logistic, log-normal, Lomax, and Weibull. Secondly, point estimation of the parameters of 
             two- and three-parameter Weibull distributions. In the case of two-parameter, twelve methods
             consist of generalized least square type 1, generalized least square type 2, L-moment, maximum 
             likelihood, logarithmic moment, moment, percentile, rank correlation, least square, weighted 
             maximum likelihood, U-statistic, weighted least square are used and investigated methods for 
             the three-parameter case are: maximum likelihood, modified moment type 1, modified moment 
             type 2, modified moment type 3, modified maximum likelihood type 1, modified maximum 
             likelihood type 2, modified maximum likelihood type 3, modified maximum likelihood type 4, mo
             ment, maximum product spacing, T-L moment, and weighted maximum likelihood. Thirdly, the
             Bayesian estimators of the three-parameter Weibull distribution developed by Green et al. (1994)
             <doi:10.2307/2533217>. Finally, estimating parameters of the three-parameter Weibull 
             distribution fitted to grouped data using three methods including approximated maximum 
             likelihood, expectation maximization, and maximum likelihood.
