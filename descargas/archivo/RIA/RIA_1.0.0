Description: Radiomics image analysis toolbox for grayscale 2D and 3D images. RIA calculates first-order,
             gray level co-occurrence matrix, gray level run length matrix and geometry-based statistics.
             Almost all calculations are done using vectorized formulas to optimize run speeds. Calculation
             of several thousands of parameters only takes minutes on a single core of a conventional PC.
