Description: Conventional methods for producing standard scores in psychometrics or biometrics 
    are often plagued with "jumps" or "gaps" (i.e., discontinuities) in norm tables and low 
    confidence for assessing extreme scores. The continuous norming method introduced by A. 
    Lenhard et al. (2016), <doi:10.1177/1073191116656437>, generates continuous test norm 
    scores on the basis of the raw data from standardization samples, without requiring 
    assumptions about the distribution of the raw data: Norm scores are directly established 
    from raw data by modeling the latter ones as a function of both percentile scores and an 
    explanatory variable (e.g., age). The method minimizes bias arising from sampling and 
    measurement error, while handling marked deviations from normality, addressing bottom 
    or ceiling effects and capturing almost all of the variance in the original norm data 
    sample.
