Description: Calculates periodograms based on (robustly) fitting periodic functions to light curves (irregularly observed time series, possibly with measurement accuracies, occurring in astroparticle physics). Three main functions are included: RobPer calculates the periodogram. Outlying periodogram bars (indicating a period) can be detected with betaCvMfit. Artificial light curves can be generated using the function tsgen. For more details see Thieler, Fried and Rathjens (2013).
