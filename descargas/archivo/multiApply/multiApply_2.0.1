Description: The base apply function and its variants, as well as the related
    functions in the 'plyr' package, typically apply user-defined functions to a
    single argument (or a list of vectorized arguments in the case of mapply). The
    'multiApply' package extends this paradigm with its only function, Apply, which
    efficiently applies functions taking one or a list of multiple unidimensional
    or multidimensional numeric arrays (or combinations thereof) as input. The input
    arrays can have different numbers of dimensions as well as different dimension
    lengths, and the applied function can return one or a list of unidimensional or
    multidimensional arrays as output. This saves development time by preventing the
    R user from writing often error-prone and memory-inefficient loops dealing with
    multiple complex arrays. Also, a remarkable feature of Apply is the transparent
    use of multi-core through its parameter 'ncores'. In contrast to the base apply
    function, this package suggests the use of 'target dimensions' as opposite
    to the 'margins' for specifying the dimensions relevant to the function to be
    applied.
