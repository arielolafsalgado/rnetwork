Description: The base apply function and its variants, as well as the related functions in the 'plyr' package, typically apply user-defined functions to a single argument (or a list of vectorized arguments in the case of mapply). The 'multiApply' package extends this paradigm to functions taking a list of multiple unidimensional or multidimensional arguments (or combinations thereof) as input, which can have different numbers of dimensions as well as different dimension lengths.
