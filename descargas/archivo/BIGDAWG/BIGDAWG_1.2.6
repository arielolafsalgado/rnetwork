Description: Data sets and functions for chi-squared Hardy-Weinberg and case-control
    association tests of highly polymorphic genetic data [e.g., human leukocyte antigen
    (HLA) data]. Performs association tests at multiple levels of polymorphism
    (haplotype, locus and HLA amino-acids) as described in Pappas DJ, Marin W, Hollenbach JA,
    Mack SJ. 2016. 'Bridging ImmunoGenomic Data Analysis Workflow Gaps (BIGDAWG): 
    An integrated case-control analysis pipeline.' Human Immunology, article in press.
    Combines rare variants to a common class to account for sparse cells in tables as
    described by Hollenbach JA, Mack SJ, Thomson G, Gourraud PA. 'Analytical methods 
    for disease association studies with immunogenetic data.' Methods Mol Biol. 2012;
    882:245-66.
