Description: Hierarchical multistate models are considered to perform the analysis of independent/clustered semi-competing risks data. The package allows to choose the specification for model components from a range of options giving users substantial flexibility, including: accelerated failure time or proportional hazards regression models; parametric or non-parametric specifications for baseline survival functions and cluster-specific random effects distribution; a Markov or semi-Markov specification for terminal event following non-terminal event. While estimation is mainly performed within the Bayesian paradigm, the package also provides the maximum likelihood estimation approach for several para- metric models. The package also includes functions for univariate survival analysis as complementary analysis tools.
