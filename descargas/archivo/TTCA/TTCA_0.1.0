Description: The analysis of microarray time series promises a deeper insight into the dynamics of the cellular response
 following stimulation. A common observation in this type of data is that some genes respond with quick,
 transient dynamics, while other genes change their expression slowly over time. The existing methods for the
 detection of significant expression dynamics often fail when the expression dynamics show a large
 heterogeneity, and often cannot cope with irregular and sparse measurements. The method proposed here is
 specifically designed for the analysis of perturbation responses. It combines different scores to capture fast and
 transient dynamics as well as slow expression changes, and deals with low replicate numbers and irregular
 sampling times. The results are given in the form of tables linked to figures. These allow to quickly recognize
 the relevance of detection, to identify possible false positives and to distinguish between changes in the early
 and later expression. An extension of the method allows the analysis of the expression dynamics of functional
 groups of genes, providing a quick overview of the cellular response. The performance of this package was
 tested on microarray data derived from lung cancer cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor.
