Description: Provides functions to generate and analyze individual-based spatially-explicit
  simulations of multi-state movements in heterogeneous landscapes, based on "resistance"
  rasters. Although originally conceived and designed to simulate spatially-explicit trajectories
  of species constrained to linear, dendritic habitats (e.g., river networks), the simulation
  algorithm is built to be highly flexible and can be applied to any (aquatic, semi-aquatic or
  terrestrial) organism. Thus, the user will be able to use the package to simulate movements
  either in homogeneous landscapes, heterogeneous landscapes (e.g. semi-aquatic animal moving
  mainly along rivers but also using the matrix), or even in highly contrasted landscapes
  (e.g. fish in a river network). The algorithm and its input parameters are the same for all
  cases, so that results are comparable. Simulated trajectories can then be used as mechanistic
  null models to test e.g. for species site fidelity and other 'Movement Ecology' hypotheses, or
  for other predictive purposes. The package should thus be relevant to explore a broad spectrum
  of ecological phenomena, such as those at the interface of animal behaviour, landscape, spatial
  and movement ecology, disease and invasive species spread, and population dynamics.
