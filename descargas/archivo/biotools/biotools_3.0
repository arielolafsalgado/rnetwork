Description: Tools designed to perform and work with cluster analysis (including Tocher's algorithm), 
	discriminant analysis and path analysis (standard and under collinearity), as well as some 
	useful miscellaneous tools for dealing with sample size and optimum plot size calculations.
	Mantel's permutation test can be found in this package. A new approach for calculating its
	power is implemented. biotools also contains the new tests for genetic covariance components.
