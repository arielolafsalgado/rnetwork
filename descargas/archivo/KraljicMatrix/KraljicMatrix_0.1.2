Description: Implements a quantified approach to the Kraljic Matrix (Kraljic, 1983, <https://hbr.org/1983/09/purchasing-must-become-supply-management>)
    for strategically analyzing a firmâ€™s purchasing portfolio. It combines multi-objective decision analysis to measure purchasing characteristics and
    uses this information to place products and services within the Kraljic Matrix.
