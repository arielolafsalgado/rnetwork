Description: This package implements statistical methods for estimating and inferring the mean of functional data. The methods are based on simultaneous confidence bands and local polynomial fitting. They feature: bandwidth selection by plug-in and cross-validation, goodness-of-fit tests for parametric models, equality tests for two-sample problems, and plotting functions.
