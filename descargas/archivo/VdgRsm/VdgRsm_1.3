Description: This package creates variance dispersion graphs (VDGs), fraction of design space (FDS) plots for second-order model designs in spherical or cuboidal regions. This package also generates the central composite designs, factorial designs, Hartley's small composite designs, Roquemore's hybrid designs, Plackett-Burman composite designs, Doehlert's uniform shell designs, Box-Behnken Designs, and exact A- and D-optimal designs.
