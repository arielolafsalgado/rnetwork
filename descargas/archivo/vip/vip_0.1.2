Description: A general framework for constructing variable importance plots from 
  various types machine learning models in R. Aside from some standard model-
  based variable importance measures, this package also provides a novel 
  approach based on partial dependence plots (PDPs) and individual conditional 
  expectation (ICE) curves as described in Greenwell et al. (2018) 
  <arXiv:1805.04755>.
