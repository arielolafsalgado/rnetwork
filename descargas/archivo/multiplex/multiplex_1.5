Description: Algebraic procedures for the analysis of multiple social networks
    are delivered with this package. Among other things, it is possible to
    create and manipulate multivariate network data with different formats,
    and there are effective ways available to treat multiple networks with
    routines that combine algebraic systems like the partially ordered
    semigroup or the semiring structure together with the relational bundles
    occurring in different types of multivariate network data sets. As well an
    algebraic approach for two-mode networks is made through Galois
    derivations between families of the pair of subsets.
