Description: Provides robust methods to detect change-points in uni- or multivariate time series. They can cope with corrupted data and heavy tails. One can detect changes in location, scale and dependence structure of a possibly multivariate time series. Procedures are based on Huberized versions of CUSUM tests proposed in Duerre and Fried (2019) <arXiv:1905.06201>.
