Description: Provides probability mass, distribution, quantile, random-variate generation, and method-of-moments parameter-estimation functions for the Delaporte distribution. The Delaporte is a discrete probability distribution which can be considered the convolution of a negative binomial distribution with a Poisson distribution. Alternatively, it can be considered a counting distribution with both Poisson and negative binomial components. It has been studied in actuarial science as a frequency distribution which has more variability than the Poisson, but less than the negative binomial.
