Description: Implements tools for building and visualising admixture graphs
    and for extracting equations from them. These equations can be compared to f-
    statistics obtained from data to test the consistency of a graph against data --
    for example by comparing the sign of f_4-statistics with the signs predicted by
    the graph -- and graph parameters (edge lengths and admixture proportions) can
    be fitted to observed statistics.
