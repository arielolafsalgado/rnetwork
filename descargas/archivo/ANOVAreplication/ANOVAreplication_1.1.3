Description: Allows for the computation of a prior predictive p-value to test replication of relevant features of original ANOVA studies. Relevant features are captured in informative hypotheses. The package also allows for the computation of sample sizes for new studies, post-hoc power calculations, and comes with a Shiny application in which all calculations can be conducted as well.
