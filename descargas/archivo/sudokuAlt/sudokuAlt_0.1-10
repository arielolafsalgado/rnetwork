Description: Tools for making, retrieving, displaying and solving sudoku games.
    This package is an alternative to the earlier sudoku-solver package,
    'sudoku'.  The present package uses a slightly different algorithm, has a
    simpler coding and presents a few more sugar tools, such as plot and print
    methods.  Solved sudoku games are of some interest in Experimental Design
    as examples of Latin Square designs with additional balance constraints.
