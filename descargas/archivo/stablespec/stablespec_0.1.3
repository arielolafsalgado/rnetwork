Description: An exploratory and heuristic approach for specification search
    in Structural Equation Modeling. The basic idea is to subsample
    the original data, and for each subset we search the
    optimal models. Here the criteria of an optimal model is defined
    by two objectives: to fit the data well and is simple (parsimonious) model.
    As these objectives are conflicting, we apply NSGA-II to optimize,
    such that to get optimal models for the whole range of model complexities.
    From these optimal models, we observe the model specifications (structures)
    that are both stable and parsimonious, called relevant. At the end we infer
    causal model from these relevant structures.
