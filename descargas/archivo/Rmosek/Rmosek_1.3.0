Author: MOSEK ApS
Contact: MOSEK ApS <rmosek@mosek.com>
Description: This is a generic meta-package designed to make the optimization
    facilities of MOSEK available from the R-language. The interface supports 
    large-scale optimization of many kinds: Mixed-integer and continuous linear,
    second-order cone, exponential cone and power cone optimization, as well as 
    continuous semidefinite optimization. Rmosek and the R-language are
    open-source projects. MOSEK is a proprietary product, but
    unrestricted trial and academic licenses are available.
