Description: To address the problem of insecurity of UDP-based DNS requests,
    Google Public DNS offers DNS resolution over an encrypted HTTPS
    connection. DNS-over-HTTPS greatly enhances privacy and security
    between a client and a recursive resolver, and complements DNSSEC
    to provide end-to-end authenticated DNS lookups. Functions that enable
    querying individual requests that bulk requests that return detailed
    responses and bulk requests are both provided. Support for reverse
    lookups is also provided. See <https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https> 
    for more information.
