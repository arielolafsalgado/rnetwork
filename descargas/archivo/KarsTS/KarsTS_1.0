Description: An R graphical user interface for karstic time series, based on the 'tcltk' package. Karstic research typically includes CO2 and Rn concentrations and microclimatic measurements. Many of these time series have a strong non-linear behavior. Gaps are often a significant problem because caves are aggressive environments for the apparels. 'KarsTS' provides linear and non-linear analysis and filling methods, as well as tools to manipulate easily time series and gap sets.
