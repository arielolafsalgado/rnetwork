Description: An R graphical user interface for karstic time series, based on the 'tcltk' package. Karstic research typically includes CO2 and 222Rn concentrations and microclimatic measurements. Many of these time series have a strong non-linear behavior. Gaps are often a significant problem because caves are aggressive environments for the measuring devices. 'KarsTS' provides linear and non-linear analysis (Marwan et al. (2007) <10.1016/j.physrep.2006.11.001>) and filling methods (Moffat et al. (2007) <doi:10.1016/j.agrformet.2007.08.011>), as well as tools to manipulate easily time series and gap sets.
