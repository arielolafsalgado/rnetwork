Description: The usual distribution functions, maximum likelihood inference and
    model diagnostics for univariate stationary extreme value mixture models
    are provided. Kernel density estimation including various boundary
    corrected kernel density estimation methods and a wide choice of kernels,
    with cross-validation likelihood based bandwidth estimator.
    Reasonable consistency with the base functions in the evd package is
    provided, so that users can safely interchange most code.
