Description: Tools for large, sparse optimal matching of treated units
	and control units in observational studies.  Provisions are
	made for refined covariate balance constraints, which include
	fine and near-fine balance as special cases.  Matches are 
	optimal in the sense that they are computed as solutions to
	network optimization problems rather than greedy algorithms. 
Depends: R (>= 3.0.0), MASS, plyr
