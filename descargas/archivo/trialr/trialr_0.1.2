Title: Clinical Trial Designs in 'rstan'
Description: A collection of clinical trial designs and methods, implemented in 
    'rstan' and R, including: the Continual Reassessment Method by O'Quigley et 
    al. (1990) <doi:10.2307/2531628>; EffTox by Thall & Cook (2004) 
    <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2004.00218.x>; and the Augmented Binary method by 
    Wason & Seaman (2013) <doi:10.1002/sim.5867>; and more. We provide functions 
    to aid model-fitting and analysis. The 'rstan' implementations may also 
    serve as a cookbook to anyone looking to extend or embellish these models. 
    We hope that this package encourages the use of Bayesian methods in clinical 
    trials. There is a preponderance of early phase trial designs because this 
    is where Bayesian methods are used most. If there is a method you would like 
    implemented, please get in touch.
