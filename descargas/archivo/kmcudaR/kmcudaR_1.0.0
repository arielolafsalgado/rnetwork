Title: 'Yinyang' K-Means and K-NN using NVIDIA CUDA
Version: 1.0.0

Description: K-means implementation is based on "Yinyang K-Means: A Drop-In Replacement of 
	the Classic K-Means with Consistent Speedup". While it introduces some overhead and many 
	conditional clauses which are bad for CUDA, it still shows 1.6-2x speedup against the Lloyd 
	algorithm. K-nearest neighbors employ the same triangle inequality idea and require 
	precalculated centroids and cluster assignments, similar to the flattened ball tree.
