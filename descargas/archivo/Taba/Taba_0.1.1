Description: Calculates the robust Taba linear and Taba rank (monotonic) 
    correlations. Test statistics as well as one sided or two sided p-values are provided 
    for Taba and Taba rank correlations. Multiple correlations and p-values can be calculated 
    simultaneously across multiple variables. In addition, users will have the option to use 
    the partial, semipartial, and generalized partial correlations; where the partial and 
    semipartial correlations use linear, logistic, or Poisson regression to modify the specified
    variable.
