Authors@R: person("Steve", "Myles", email = "steve@mylesandmyles.info", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Convert English letters to numbers or numbers to English letters as 
    on a telephone keypad. When converting letters to numbers, a character 
    vector is returned with "A," "B," or "C" becoming 2, "D," "E", or "F" 
    becoming 3, etc. When converting numbers to letters, a character vector is 
    returned with multiple elements (i.e., "2" becomes a vector of "A," "B," and 
    "C").
