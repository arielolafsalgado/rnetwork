Description: Implements the routines and algorithms developed and analysed in "Multiple systems estimation for Sparse Capture Data: Inferential Challenges when there are Non-Overlapping Lists" Chan, L, Silverman, B. W., Vincent, K (2019) <arXiv:1902.05156>. This package explicitly handles situations where there are pairs of lists which have no observed individuals in common.
