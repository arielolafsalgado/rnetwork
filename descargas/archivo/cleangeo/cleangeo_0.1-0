Description: 
  Provides a set of utility tools to inspect spatial objects, facilitate
  handling and reporting of topology errors and geometry validity issues.
  Finally, it provides a geometry cleaner that will fix all geometry problems,
  and eliminate (at least reduce) the likelihood of having issues when doing
  spatial data processing.
