Description: Algorithms for fitting model-based penalized coefficient paths. Currently the models include penalized Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. The penalties include least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and minimax concave penalty (MCP), and each possibly combining with L_2 penalty.
