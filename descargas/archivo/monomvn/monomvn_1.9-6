Description: Estimation of multivariate normal and student-t data of 
             arbitrary dimension where the pattern of missing data is monotone.
             Through the use of parsimonious/shrinkage regressions 
             (plsr, pcr, lasso, ridge,  etc.), where standard regressions fail, 
             the package can handle a nearly arbitrary amount of missing data. 
             The current version supports maximum likelihood inference and 
	     a full Bayesian approach employing scale-mixtures for Gibbs sampling.
	     Monotone data augmentation extends this 
	     Bayesian approach to arbitrary missingness patterns.  
	     A fully functional standalone interface to the Bayesian lasso 
	     (from Park & Casella), Normal-Gamma (from Griffin & Brown),
             Horseshoe (from Carvalho, Polson, & Scott), and ridge regression 
             with model selection via Reversible Jump, and student-t errors 
             (from Geweke) is also provided.
