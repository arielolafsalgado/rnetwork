Description: Intended for larger-than-memory tabular data, 'prt' objects provide an interface to read row and/or column subsets into memory as data.table objects. Data queries, constructed as 'R' expressions, are evaluated using the non-standard evaluation framework provided by 'rlang' and file-backing is powered by the fast and efficient 'fst' package.
