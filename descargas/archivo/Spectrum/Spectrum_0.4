Title: Fast Adaptive Spectral Clustering for Single and Multi-View Data
Version: 0.4
Author: Christopher R John, David Watson
Maintainer: Christopher R John <chris.r.john86@gmail.com>
Description: A self-tuning spectral clustering method for single or multi-view data. 'Spectrum' uses a new type of adaptive density aware kernel that strengthens local connections in the graph. For integrating multi-view data and reducing noise a tensor product graph data integration and diffusion procedure is used. 'Spectrum' analyses eigenvector variance or distribution to determine the number of clusters. 'Spectrum' is well suited for a wide range of data, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian structures.
