Description: Calculates maximum likelihood estimate, exact and asymptotic confidence intervals, and exact and asymptotic goodness of fit p-values for concentration of infectious units from serial limiting dilution assays. This package uses the likelihood equation, exact goodness of fit p-values, and exact confidence intervals described in Meyers et al. (1994) <http://jcm.asm.org/content/32/3/732.full.pdf>. This software is also implemented as a web application through the Shiny R package <https://iupm.shinyapps.io/sldassay/>.
