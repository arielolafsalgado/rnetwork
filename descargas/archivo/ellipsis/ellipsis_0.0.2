Package: ellipsis
Version: 0.0.2
Title: Tools for Working with ...
Description: In S3 generics, it's useful to take ... so that methods can
    have additional argument. But this flexibility comes at a cost: misspelled
    arguments will be silently ignored. The ellipsis packages is an experiment
    that allows a generic to warn if any arguments passed in ... are not
    used.
