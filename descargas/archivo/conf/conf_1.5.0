Description: Enables: (1) plotting two-dimensional confidence regions, (2) coverage analysis
  of confidence region simulations and (3) calculating confidence intervals and the associated 
  actual coverage for binomial proportions. Each is given in greater detail next. 
  (1) Plots the two-dimensional confidence region for probability distribution parameters 
  (supported distribution suffixes: cauchy, gamma, invgauss, logis, llogis, lnorm, norm, unif, 
  weibull) corresponding to a user-given complete or right-censored dataset and level of 
  significance.  The crplot() algorithm plots more points in areas of greater curvature to 
  ensure a smooth appearance throughout the confidence region boundary.  An alternative 
  heuristic plots a specified number of points at roughly uniform intervals along its boundary. 
  Both heuristics build upon the radial profile log-likelihood ratio technique for plotting 
  confidence regions given by Jaeger (2016) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2016.1182946>. 
  (2) Performs confidence region coverage simulations for a random sample drawn from a user-
  specified parametric population distribution, or for a user-specified dataset and point of 
  interest with coversim(). (3) Calculates confidence interval bounds for a binomial 
  proportion with binomTest(), calculates the actual coverage with binomTestCoverage(), and 
  plots the actual coverage with binomTestCoveragePlot(). Calculates confidence interval 
  bounds for the binomial proportion using an ensemble of constituent confidence intervals 
  with binomTestEnsemble().
