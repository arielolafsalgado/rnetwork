Description: Plots the two-dimensional confidence region for probability distribution (Weibull or
  inverse Gaussian) parameters corresponding to a user given dataset and level of significance. 
  The crplot() algorithm plots more points in areas of greater curvature to ensure a smooth
  appearance throughout the confidence region boundary.  An alternative heuristic plots a specified
  number of points at roughly uniform intervals along its boundary.  Both heuristics build upon the 
  radial profile log-likelihood ratio technique for plotting two-dimensional confidence regions given 
  by Jaeger (2016) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2016.1182946>.
