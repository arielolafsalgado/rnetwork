Description: Functions for performing time domain signal coding as used in Chesmore (2001) <doi:10.1016/S0003-682X(01)00009-3>, and related tasks. This package creates the standard S-matrix and A-matrix (with variable lag), has tools to convert coding matrices into distributed matrices, provides published codebooks and allows for extraction of code sequences.
