Description: Compute standard Non-Compartmental Analysis (NCA)
    parameters and summarize them.  In addition to this core work, it
    also provides standardized plotting routines, basic assessments
    for biocomparison or drug interaction, and model-based estimation
    routines for calculating doses to reach specific values of AUC or
    Cmax.
