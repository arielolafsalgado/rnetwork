Description: A simple R wrapper for the Java BiBit algorithm from "A
    biclustering algorithm for extracting bit-patterns from binary datasets"
    from Domingo et al. (2011) <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr464>. An simple adaption for the BiBit algorithm which allows noise in the biclusters is also introduced. Further, a workflow to guide the algorithm towards given patterns is included as well.
