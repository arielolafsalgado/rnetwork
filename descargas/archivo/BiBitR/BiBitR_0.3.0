Description: A simple R wrapper for the Java BiBit algorithm from "A
    biclustering algorithm for extracting bit-patterns from binary datasets"
    from Domingo et al. (2011) <DOI:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr464>. An simple adaption for the BiBit algorithm which allows noise in the biclusters is also introduced as well as a function to guide the algorithm towards given (sub)patterns. Further, a workflow to derive noisy biclusters from discoverd larger column patterns is included as well.
