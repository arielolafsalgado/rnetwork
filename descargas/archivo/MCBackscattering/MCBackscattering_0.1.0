Description: Monte Carlo simulation is a stochastic method computing trajectories of photons in media. Surface backscattering is performing calculations in semi-infinite media and summarizing photon flux leaving the surface. This simulation is modeling the optical measurement of diffuse reflectance using an incident light beam. The semi-infinite media is considered to have flat surface. Media, typically biological tissue, is described by four optical parameters: absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient, anisotropy factor, refractive index. The media is assumed to be homogeneous.
    Computational parameters of the simulation include: number of photons, radius of incident light beam, lowest photon energy threshold, intensity profile (halo) radius, spatial resolution of intensity profile.
