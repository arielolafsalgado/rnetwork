Title: Age-Structured Spatio-Temporal Models for Infectious Disease
        Counts
Description: Meyer and Held (2017) <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxw051> present an
    age-structured spatio-temporal model for infectious disease counts. The
    approach is illustrated in a case study on norovirus gastroenteritis in
    Berlin, 2011-2015, by age group, city district and week, using additional
    contact data from the POLYMOD survey. This package contains the data and
    code to reproduce the results from the paper, see 'demo("hhh4contacts")'.
