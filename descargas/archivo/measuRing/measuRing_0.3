Description: Identification of ring borders on scanned image sections from dendrochronological samples. Processesing of image reflectances to produce gray matrices and a time series of smoothed gray values. Luminance data is plotted on segmented images for users to perform both: visual identification of ring borders, or control of automatic detection. Routines to visually include/exclude ring borders on the R graphical device, or automatically detect ring borders using a linear detection algorithm. This algorithm detects ring borders according to positive/negative extreme values in the smoothed time-series of gray values.
