Description: A glycolipid mass spectrometry technology has the potential to accurately identify individual bacterial species from polymicrobial samples. To develop bacterial identification algorithms (e.g. machine learning) using this glycolipid technology, it is necessary to generate a large number of various in-silico polymicrobial mass spectra that are similar to real mass spectra. 'MGMS2' (Membrane Glycolipid Mass Spectrum Simulator) generates such in-silico mass spectra, considering errors in m/z (mass-to-charge ratio) and variances of intensity values, occasions of missing signature ions, and noise peaks. It estimates summary statistics of monomicrobial mass spectra for each strain or species and simulates polymicrobial glycolipid mass spectra using the summary statistics of monomicrobial mass spectra.
