Description: Includes bases for litholog generation: graphical functions
    based on R base graphics, interval management functions and svg importation 
    functions among others. Also include stereographic projection functions, 
    and other functions made to deal with large datasets while keeping options
    to get into the details of the data.
    The palaeomagnetism functions are based on:
