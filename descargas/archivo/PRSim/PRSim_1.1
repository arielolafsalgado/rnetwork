Description: Provides a simulation framework to simulate streamflow time series with similar
  main characteristics as observed data. These characteristics include the distribution of daily 
  streamflow values and their temporal correlation as expressed by short- and long-range 
  dependence. The approach is based on the randomization of the phases of the Fourier 
  transform. We further use the flexible four-parameter Kappa distribution, which allows 
  for the extrapolation to yet unobserved low and high flows. Alternatively, the empirical or any other distribution can be used. A detailed description of 
  the simulation approach and an application example can be found 
  in <https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/hess-2019-142/>.
