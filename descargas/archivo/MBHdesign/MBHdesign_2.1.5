Version: 2.1.5
Author: Scott D. Foster
Description: Provides spatially balanced designs from a set of (contiguous) potential sampling locations in a study region for point-based and for transect-based surveys. Accommodates, without detrimental effects on spatial balance, sites that the researcher wishes to include in the survey for reasons other than the current randomisation (legacy sites).
