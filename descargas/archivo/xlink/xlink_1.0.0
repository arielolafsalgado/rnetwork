Description: The expression of X-chromosome undergoes three possible biological processes: X-chromosome
             inactivation (XCI), escape of the X-chromosome inactivation (XCI-E),and skewed X-chromosome                    
             inactivation (XCI-S). To analyze the X-linked genetic association for phenotype such as                         
             continuous, binary, and time-to-event outcomes with the actual process unknown, we propose a unified            
             approach of maximizing the likelihood or partial likelihood over all of the potential biological             
             processes. The methods are described in Wei Xu, Meiling Hao (2017) <doi:10.1002/gepi.22097>.
