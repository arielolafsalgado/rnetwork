Description: Fits a piecewise exponential hazard to survival data using a
    Hierarchical Bayesian model with an Intrinsic Conditional Autoregressive
    formulation for the spatial dependency in the hazard rates for each piece.
    This function uses Metropolis- Hastings-Green MCMC to allow the number of split
    points to vary. This function outputs graphics that display the histogram of
    the number of split points and the trace plots of the hierarchical parameters.
    The function outputs a list that contains the posterior samples for the number
    of split points, the location of the split points, and the log hazard rates
    corresponding to these splits. Additionally, this outputs the posterior samples
    of the two hierarchical parameters, Mu and Sigma^2.
