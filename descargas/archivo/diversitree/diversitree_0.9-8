Description: Contains a number of comparative phylogenetic methods,
  mostly focusing on analysing diversification and character
  evolution.  Contains implementations of 'BiSSE' (Binary State
  Speciation and Extinction) and its unresolved tree extensions,
  'MuSSE' (Multiple State Speciation and Extinction), 'QuaSSE',
  'GeoSSE', and 'BiSSE-ness' Other included methods include Markov
  models of discrete and continuous trait evolution and constant rate
  speciation and extinction.
