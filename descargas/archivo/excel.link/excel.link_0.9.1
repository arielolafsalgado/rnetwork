Description: Allows access to data in running instance of Microsoft Excel
    (e. g. 'xl[a1] = xl[b2]*3' and so on). Graphics can be transferred with 
    'xl[a1] = current.graphics()'. There is an Excel workbook with examples of 
    calling R from Excel in the 'doc' folder. It tries to keep things as 
    simple as possible - there are no needs in any additional 
    installations besides R, only 'VBA' code in the Excel workbook. 
    Microsoft Excel is required for this package.
