Title: Multiple Change-Point Detection for High-Dimensional GARCH
        Processes

Description: Implements a segmentation algorithm for multiple change-point detection in high-dimensional GARCH processes. It simultaneously segments GARCH processes by identifying 'common' change-points, each of which can be shared by a subset or all of the component time series as a change-point in their within-series and/or cross-sectional correlation structure.
