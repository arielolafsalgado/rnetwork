Description: Implements various procedures for finding 
	     multiple change-points through the use of U-statistics. 
	     The procedures do not make any distributional assumptions 
	     other than the existence of certain absolute moments. Hierarchical 
	     and exact search methods are included. All methods return the 
	     set of estimated change-points as well as other summary information.
