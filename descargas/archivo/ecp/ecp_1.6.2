Description: Implements hierarchical procedures to find multiple change-points 
	     through the use of U-statistics. The procedures do not make any 
	     distributional assumptions other than the existence of certain 
	     absolute moments. Both agglomerative and divisive procedures are
	     included. These methods return the set of estimated change-points 
	     as well as other summary information.
