Description: These tools help you to assess if a financial
    portfolio aligns with climate goals. They summarize key metrics
    attributed to the portfolio (e.g. production, emission factors), and
    calculate targets based on climate scenarios. They implement in R the
    last step of the free software 'PACTA' (Paris Agreement Capital
    Transition Assessment; <https://2degrees-investing.org/>). Financial
    institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital allocation impacts
    the climate.
