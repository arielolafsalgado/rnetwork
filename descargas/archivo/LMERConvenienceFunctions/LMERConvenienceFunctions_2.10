Description: The main function of the package is to perform backward selection of fixed effects, forward fitting of the random effects, and post-hoc analysis using parallel capabilities. Other functionality includes the computation of ANOVAs with upper- or lower-bound p-values and R-squared values for each model term, model criticism plots, data trimming on model residuals, and data visualization. The data to run examples is contained in package LCF_data.
