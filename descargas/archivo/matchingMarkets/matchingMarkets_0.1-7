Title: Analysis of Stable Matchings
Author: Thilo Klein
Maintainer: Thilo Klein <thilo@klein.uk>
Description: Implements structural estimators to correct for 
    the sample selection bias from observed outcomes in matching 
    markets. This includes one-sided matching of agents into 
    groups as well as two-sided matching of students to schools. 
    The package also contains R code for three matching algorithms: 
    the deferred-acceptance (or Gale-Shapley) algorithm for 
    stable marriage and college admissions problems, the 
    top-trading-cycles algorithm for house allocation and a 
    partitioning linear programme for the roommates problem.
