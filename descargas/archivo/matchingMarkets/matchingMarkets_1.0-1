Description: Implements structural estimators to correct for
    the sample selection bias from observed outcomes in matching
    markets. This includes one-sided matching of agents into
    groups as well as two-sided matching of students to schools.
    The package also contains algorithms to find stable matchings
    in the three most common matching problems: the stable roommates
    problem, the college admissions problem, and the house
    allocation problem.
