Title: Analysis of Stable Matchings
Author: Thilo Klein
Maintainer: Thilo Klein <thilo@klein.uk>
Description: Implements structural estimators to correct for
    the sample selection bias from observed outcomes in matching
    markets. This includes one-sided matching of agents into
    groups as well as two-sided matching of students to schools.
    The package also contains R code for three matching algorithms:
    the deferred-acceptance (or Gale-Shapley) algorithm for
    stable marriage and college admissions problems, the
    top-trading-cycles algorithm for house allocation and a
    partitioning linear programme for the roommates problem.
