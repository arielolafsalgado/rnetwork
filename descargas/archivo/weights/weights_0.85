Description: Provides a variety of functions for producing simple weighted statistics, such as weighted Pearson's correlations, partial correlations, Chi-Squared statistics, histograms, and t-tests.  Also now includes some software for quickly recoding survey data and plotting point estimates from interaction terms in regressions (and multiply imputed regressions).  Future versions of the package will be more closely integrated with "anesrake" and additional weighting tools and will provide the option to find weighting benchmarks and weight data using a variety of methodologies.  NOTE: Weighted partial correlation calculations temporarily pulled to address a bug.
