Title: Minimization Tool for Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Data
        Analysis
Description: This is a set of minimization tools (maximum likelihood estimation and least square fitting) to solve examples in the Johan Gabrielsson and Dan Weiner's book "Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Data Analysis - Concepts and Applications" 5th ed. (ISBN:9198299107). Examples include linear and nonlinear compartmental model, turn-over model, single or multiple dosing bolus/infusion/oral models, allometry, toxicokinetics, reversible metabolism, in-vitro/in-vivo extrapolation, enterohepatic circulation, metabolite modeling, Emax model, inhibitory model, tolerance model, oscillating response model, enantiomer interaction model, effect compartment model, drug-drug interaction model, receptor occupancy model, and rebound phenomena model.
