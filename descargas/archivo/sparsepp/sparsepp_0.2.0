Description: Provides interface to 'sparsepp' - fast, memory efficient hash map. 
    It is derived from Google's excellent 'sparsehash' implementation.
    We believe 'sparsepp' provides an unparalleled combination of performance and memory usage, 
    and will outperform your compiler's unordered_map on both counts. 
    Only Google's 'dense_hash_map' is consistently faster, at the cost of much greater 
    memory usage (especially when the final size of the map is not known in advance).
