Description: Support software for Statistical Analysis and Data
        Display (First Edition, Springer, ISBN 0-387-40270-5) and
        (Second Edition, Springer, ISBN x-xxx-xxxxx-x).  This
        contemporary presentation of statistical methods features
        extensive use of graphical displays for exploring data and for
        displaying the analysis.  The second edition includes
        redesigned graphics and additional chapters. The authors
        emphasize how to construct and interpret graphs, discuss
        principles of graphical design, and show how accompanying
        traditional tabular results are used to confirm the visual
        impressions derived directly from the graphs. Many of the
        graphical formats are novel and appear here for the first time
        in print.  All chapters have exercises.  All functions
        introduced in the book are in the package.  R code for all
        examples, both graphs and tables, in the book is included in
        the scripts directory of the package.
