Description: Bindings to GnuPG for working with OpenGPG (RFC4880) cryptographic methods.
    Includes utilities for public key encryption, creating and verifying digital signatures,
    and managing your local keyring. Note that some functionality depends on the version of 
    GnuPG that is installed on the system. In particular GnuPG 2 mandates the use of 
    'gpg-agent' for entering passphrases, which only works if R runs in a terminal session.
