Description: Provides a backward-pipe operator for 'magrittr' (%<%) or 
    'pipeR' (%<<%) that allows for a performing operations from right-to-left. 
    This is useful in instances where there is right-to-left ordering commonly 
    observed with nested structures such as trees/directories and markup 
    languages such as HTML and XML.
