Title: Tools for Estimating Discrete Choice Models
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Stephane Hess, David Palma
Maintainer: David Palma <D.Palma@leeds.ac.uk>
Description: The Choice Modelling Centre at the 
    University of Leeds has developed flexible 
    estimation code for choice models in R. 
    Users are able to write their own likelihood
    functions or use a mix of already available 
    ones. Mixing, in the form of random coefficients 
    and components is allowed for all models. Both 
    classical and Bayesian estimation are available. 
    Multi-threading processing is supported. 
    For more information on discrete choice models
