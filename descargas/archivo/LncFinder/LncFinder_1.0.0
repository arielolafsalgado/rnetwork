Description: Functions for predicting sequences are mRNAs or long non-coding RNAs.
    Default models are trained on human, mouse and wheat datasets by employing 
    SVM. Features are based on intrinsic composition of sequence, EIIP value 
    (electron-ion interaction pseudopotential) and secondary structure. The model
    can also be built on users' own data.
