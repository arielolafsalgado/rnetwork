Version: 0.2.1
Author: Joachim Zuckarelli
Maintainer: Joachim Zuckarelli <joachim@zuckarelli.de>
Description: Allows to provide live interpretations and explanations of statistical 
    functions in R. These interpretations and explanations are shown when the explained function 
    is called by the user. They can interact with the values of the explained function's actual 
    results to offer relevant, meaningful insights. The interpretations and explanations 
    are based on an easy-to-use XML format that allows to include R code to interact with the 
    returns of the explained function.
