Title: Generate PDFs and CDFs from Binned Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: David J. Hunter and McKalie Drown
Maintainer: Dave Hunter <dhunter@westmont.edu>
Description: Provides several methods for generating density functions
    based on binned data. Data are assumed to be nonnegative, but the bin widths
    need not be uniform, and the top bin may be unbounded. All PDF smoothing methods
    maintain the areas specified by the binned data. (Equivalently, all CDF
    smoothing methods interpolate the points specified by the binned data.) An
    estimate for the mean of the distribution may be supplied as an optional
    argument, which greatly improves the reliability of statistics computed from
    the smoothed density functions. Methods include step function, recursive
    subdivision, and optimized spline.
