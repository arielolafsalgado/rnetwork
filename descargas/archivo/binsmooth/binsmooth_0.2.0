Title: Generate PDFs and CDFs from Binned Data
Version: 0.2.0
Author: David J. Hunter and McKalie Drown

Description: Provides several methods for generating density functions
    based on binned data. Methods include step function, recursive
    subdivision, and optimized spline. Data are assumed to be nonnegative, 
    but the bin widths need not be equal, and the top bin need not have an 
    upper bound. All PDF smoothing methods maintain the areas specified by 
    the binned data. (Equivalently, all CDF smoothing methods interpolate 
    the points specified by the binned data.) An estimate for the mean of 
    the distribution may be supplied as an optional argument, which greatly 
    improves the reliability of statistics computed from the smoothed density 
    functions. Includes methods for estimating the Gini coefficient, the 
    Theil index, percentiles, and random deviates from a smoothed 
    distribution. Among the three methods, the optimized spline (splinebins) 
    is recommended for most purposes. The percentile and random-draw 
    functions only support splinebins.
