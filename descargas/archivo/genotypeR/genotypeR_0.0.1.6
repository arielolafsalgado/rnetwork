Description: We implement a common genotyping workflow with a standardized software interface. 'genotypeR' designs genotyping markers from vcf files, outputs markers for multiplexing suitability on various platforms (Sequenom and Illumina GoldenGate), and provides various QA/QC and analysis functions. We developed this package to analyze data in Stevison LS, SA Sefick, CA Rushton, and RM Graze. Accepted. Invited Review: Recombination rate plasticity: revealing mechanisms by design.
