Description: We implement a common genotyping workflow with a standardized software interface. 'genotypeR' designs genotyping markers from vcf files, outputs markers for multiplexing suitability on various platforms (Sequenom and Illumina GoldenGate), and provides various QA/QC and analysis functions. We developed this package to analyze data in Stevison LS, SA Sefick, CA Rushton, and RM Graze. 2017. Invited Review: Recombination rate plasticity: revealing mechanisms by design. Philosophical Transactions Royal Society London B Biol Sci 372:1-14. <DOI:10.1098/rstb.2016.0459>, and have published it here Sefick, S.A., M.A. Castronova, and L.S. Stevison. 2017.
