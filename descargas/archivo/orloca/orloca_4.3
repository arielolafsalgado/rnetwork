Description: Objects and methods to handle and solve the min-sum location problem, also known as Fermat-Weber problem. The min-sum location problem search for a point such that the weighted sum of the distances to the demand points are minimized. See "The Fermat-Weber location problem revisited" by Brimberg, Mathematical Programming, 1, pg. 71-76, 1995. <DOI:10.1007/BF01592245>. General global optimization algorithms are used to solve the problem, along with the adhoc Weiszfeld method, see "Sur le point pour lequel la Somme des distances de n points donnes est minimum", by Weiszfeld, Tohoku Mathematical Journal, First Series, 43, pg. 355-386, 1937.
