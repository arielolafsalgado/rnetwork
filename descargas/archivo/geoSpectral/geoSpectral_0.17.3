Description: Provides S4 classes and data import, preprocessing, graphing, 
    manipulation and export methods for geo-Spectral datasets (datasets with space/time/spectral 
    dimensions). These type of data are frequently collected within earth observation projects 
    (remote sensing, spectroscopy, bio-optical oceanography, mining, agricultural, atmospheric, 
    environmental or similar branch of science).
