Description: Create pretty visualizations of alpha-helical
    peptide sequences in R. The amino acid type (polar, hydrophobic, etc.) is
    denoted by color. This package allows creation of helical wheels, and the
    newer Wenxiang diagrams. Future versions aim to include increased
    customizability of the two existing visualizations, as well as a
    visualization for the helical net diagram.
