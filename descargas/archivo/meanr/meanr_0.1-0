Title: Basic Sentiment Analysis Scorer
Version: 0.1-0
Description: A popular technique in text analysis today is sentiment analysis, 
    or trying to determine the overall emotional attitude of a piece of text
    (positive or negative).  We provide a new, basic implementation of a common
    method for computing sentiment, whereby words are scored as positive or
    negative according to a "dictionary", and then an average of those scores
    for the document is produced.  The package uses the 'Hu' and 'Liu' sentiment
    dictionary for assigning sentiment.
