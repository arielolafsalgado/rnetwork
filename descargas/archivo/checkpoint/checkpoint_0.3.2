Title: Install Packages from Snapshots on the Checkpoint Server for
        Reproducibility
Description: The goal of checkpoint is to solve the problem of package
    reproducibility in R. Specifically, checkpoint allows you to install
    packages as they existed on CRAN on a specific snapshot date as if you had
    a CRAN time machine.  To achieve reproducibility, the checkpoint() function
    installs the packages required or called by your project and scripts to a
    local library exactly as they existed at the specified point in time. Only
    those packages are available to your project, thereby avoiding any package
    updates that came later and may have altered your results. In this way,
    anyone using checkpoint's checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of
    your scripts or projects at any time. To create the snapshot archives, once
    a day (at midnight UTC) we refresh the Austria CRAN mirror, on the "Managed
    R Archived Network" server (http://mran.revolutionanalytics.com/).
    Immediately after completion of the rsync mirror process, we take a
    snapshot, thus creating the archive. Snapshot archives exist starting from
    2014-09-17.
