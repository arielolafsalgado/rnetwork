Description: Analyzes group patterns using discourse analysis data with graph theory mathematics. Takes the order of which individuals talk and converts it to a network edge and weight list. Returns the density, centrality, centralization, and subgroup information for each group. Based on the analytical framework laid out in Chai et al. (2019) <doi:10.1187/cbe.18-11-0222>.
