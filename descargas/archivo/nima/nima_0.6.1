Description: Miscellaneous R functions developed as collateral damage over the
    course of work in statistical and scientific computing for research. These
    include, for example, utilities that supplement existing idiosyncrasies of
    the R language, extend existing plotting functionality and aesthetics, help
    prepare data objects for imputation, and extend access to command line tools
    and systems-level information.
