Description: Miscellaneous R functions developed over the course of statistical
    research and scientific computing. These include, for example, utilities
    that supplement existing idiosyncrasies of the R language, extend existing
    plotting functionality and aesthetics, provide alternative presentations of
    matrix decompositions, and extend access to command line tools and
    systems-level information.
