Description: Kernel-based methods are powerful methods for integrating 
    heterogeneous types of data. mixKernel aims at providing methods to combine
    kernel for unsupervised exploratory analysis. Different solutions are 
    provided to compute a meta-kernel, in a consensus way or in a way that 
    best preserves the original topology of the data. mixKernel also integrates
    kernel PCA to visualize similarities between samples in a non linear space
    and from the multiple source point of view. Functions to assess and display
    important variables are also provided in the package.
