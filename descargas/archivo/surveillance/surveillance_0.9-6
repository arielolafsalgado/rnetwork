Description: A framework for the development and the evaluation
	of outbreak detection algorithms in univariate and multivariate
	routine collected public health surveillance data. 
	Currently the package contains an 
	implementation of the procedures described in Stroup et. al (1989), 
	Farrington et. al (1996), a Bayesian approach and the method used 
	at the Robert Koch Institute, Germany. The package contains 
	several real-world datasets and the ability to simulate outbreak data.
