Description: This package contains functions to build and deploy an ensemble
    consisting of six different sub-ensembles: Bagged Logistic Regressions,
    Random Forest, Stochastic AdaBoost, Kernel Factory, Bagged Neural Networks,
    Bagged Support Vector Machines. Functions to cross-validate the Hybrid
    Ensemble and plot and summarize the results are also provided. There is
    also a function to assess the importance of the predictors.
