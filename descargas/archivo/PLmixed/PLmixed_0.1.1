Description: Utilizes the 'lme4' package and the optim() function from 'stats'
    to estimate (generalized) linear mixed models (GLMM) with factor
    structures using a profile likelihood approach, as outlined in
    Jeon and Rabe-Hesketh (2012) <doi:10.3102/1076998611417628>.
    Factor analysis and item response models can be extended to allow
    for an arbitrary number of nested and crossed random effects,
    making it useful for multilevel and cross-classified models.
