Description: Computing and plotting joint confidence regions and intervals. Regions include classical ellipsoids, minimum-volume or minimum-length regions, and an empirical Bayes region. Intervals include the TOST procedure with ordinary or expanded intervals and a fixed-sequence procedure. Such regions and intervals are useful e.g., for the assessment of multi-parameter (bio-)equivalence. Joint confidence regions for the mean and variance of a normal distribution are available as well.
