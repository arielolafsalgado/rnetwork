Description: Calculating Pst values to assess differentiation among populations from a set of quantitative traits is the primary purpose of such a package. The bootstrap method provides confidence intervals and distribution histograms of Pst. Variations of Pst in function of the parameter c/h^2 are studied as well. Finally, the package proposes different transformations especially to eliminate any variation resulting from allometric growth (calculation of residuals from linear regressions, Reist standardizations or Aitchison transformation).
