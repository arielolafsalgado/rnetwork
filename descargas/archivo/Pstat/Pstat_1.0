Description: Calculating Pst values to assess differentiation among populations from a set of quantitative traits is the primary purpose of such a package. Pst value is an index that measures the level of phenotypic differentiation among populations (Leinonen et al., 2006). The bootstrap method provides confidence intervals and distribution histograms of Pst. Variations of Pst in function of the parameter c/h^2 are studied as well. Finally, the package proposes different transformations especially to eliminate any variation resulting from allometric growth (calculation of residuals from linear regressions, Reist standardizations or Aitchison transformation).
