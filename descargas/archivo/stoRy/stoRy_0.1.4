Description: An implementation of 1) the hypergeometric test for over-representation of literary themes in a storyset (a list of stories) relative to a background list of stories, and 2) a recommendation system that takes a user-selected story as input and returns a ranked list of similar stories on the basis of shared themes. The package is currently implemented for the episodes of the Star Trek television franchise series The Original Series (TOS), The Animated Series (TAS), The Next Generation (TNG), and Voyager (VOY).
