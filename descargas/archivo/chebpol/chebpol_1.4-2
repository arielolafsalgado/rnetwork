Title: Multivariate Chebyshev Interpolation

SystemRequirements: fftw3 (>= 3.1.2)
Description: Contains methods for creating multivariate Chebyshev
  interpolations of functions on a hypercube. If available through fftw3, the DCT-II/FFT
  is used to compute the coefficients, so it is reasonably fast. Some interpolation methods for
  multivariate non-Chebyshev grids are also provided, as well as polyharmonic
  splines with a linear term.
