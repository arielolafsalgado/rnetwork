Description: Variable/Feature selection in high or ultra-high dimensional
    settings has gained a lot of attention recently specially in cancer genomic
    studies. This package provides a Bayesian approach to tackle this problem,
    where it exploits mixture of point masses at zero and nonlocal priors to
    improve the performance of variable selection and coefficient estimation.
    It performs variable selection for binary response and survival time
    response datasets which are widely used in biostatistic and bioinformatics
    community. Benefiting from parallel computing ability, it reports necessary
    outcomes of Bayesian variable selection such as Highest Posterior
    Probability Model (HPPM), Median Probability Model (MPM) and posterior
    inclusion probability for each of the covariates in the model. The option
    to use Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is also part of this package that can
    be exploited for predictive power measurements in real datasets.
