Description: Provides tools for working with nonlinear least squares problems.
      It is intended to eventually supersede the nls() function in the R distribution.
      For example, nls() specifically does NOT deal with small or zero
      residual problems as its Gauss-Newton method frequently stops with 'singular 
	gradient' messages. nlsr is based on the now-deprecated package nlmrt,
	and has refactored functions and R-language symbolic derivative features.
