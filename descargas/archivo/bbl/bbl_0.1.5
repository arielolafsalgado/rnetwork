Description: Supervised learning using Boltzmann Bayes model inference, 
    which extends naive Bayes model to include interactions. Enables 
    classification of data into multiple response groups based on a large 
    number of discrete predictors that can take factor values of 
    heterogeneous levels. Either pseudo-likelihood and mean field 
    inference can be used with L2 regularization, cross-validation, and 
    prediction on new data.
