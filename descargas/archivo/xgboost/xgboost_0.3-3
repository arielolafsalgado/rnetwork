Description: Xgboost is short for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, which is an 
    efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting framework. 
    This package is an R wrapper of xgboost. The package includes efficient 
    linear model solver and tree learning algorithms. The package can automatically 
    do parallel computation with OpenMP, and it can be more than 10 times faster
    than existing gradient boosting packages such as gbm. It supports various
    objective functions, including regression, classification and ranking. The
    package is made to be extensible, so that users are also allowed to define
    their own objectives easily.
