Description: Assessing the assumption of multivariate normality is required by many parametric multivariate statistical methods, such as discriminant analysis, principal component analysis, MANOVA, etc. Here, we present an R package to asses multivariate normality. The MVN package contains three most widely used multivariate normality tests, including Mardia's, Henze-Zirkler's and Royston's multivariate normality tests.
