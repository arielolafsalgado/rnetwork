Description: Assessing the assumption of multivariate normality is required by many parametric multivariate statistical methods, such as discriminant analysis, principal component analysis, MANOVA, etc. Here, we present an R package to asses multivariate normality. The MVN package contains three widely used multivariate normality tests, including Mardia's, Henze-Zirkler's, Royston's, graphical approaches, including chi-square Q-Q plot, perspective plot and contour plot and two outlier detection methods based on Mahalanobis distance. We have also developed web-tool version of the package which is available at http://www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/MVN/.
