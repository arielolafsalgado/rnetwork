Description: A wrapper of different indices and networks commonly used in 
  Economic Complexity to explore bipartite relations such as countries and their
  exported products. These methods are also useful for different kind of 
  relations such as countries and their spoken languages.
  The functions within this package correspond to code implementations of the 
  equations described in Hausmann, et al. (2005) <doi:10.3386/w11905>, 
  Hausmann, et al. (2014) <doi:10.7551/mitpress/9647.001.0001>, and 
  Mariani, et al. (2015) <doi:10.1140/epjb/e2015-60298-7>.
