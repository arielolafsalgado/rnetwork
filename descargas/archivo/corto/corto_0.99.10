Description: We present 'corto' (Correlation Tool), a simple package to infer
 gene regulatory networks using DPI (Data Processing Inequality) and bootstrapping
 to recover edges. An initial step is performed to calculate all significant
 edges between a list of source nodes (centroids) and target genes.
 Then all triplets containing two centroids and one target are tested
 in a DPI step which removes edges. A bootstrapping
 process then calculates the robustness of the network, eventually re-adding
 edges previously removed by DPI. The package implements a similar pipeline as
 ARACNe-AP (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks with
 Adaptive Partitioning) by Giorgi (2016) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw216>)
 with optimizations to run outside a  computing cluster (most notably
 correlation to infer feature dependencies instead of Mutual Information).
