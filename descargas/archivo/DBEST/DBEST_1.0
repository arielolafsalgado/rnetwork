Description: An algorithm for analysing vegetation time series with two main application domains - generalising vegetation trends and characterizing vegetation trend changes. The algorithm simplifies the trend into linear segments using one of three parameters: a generalisation threshold parameter, the largest changes, or a threshold for the magnitude of changes. The outputs are the simplified trend, the change type (abrupt or non-abrupt), and the time and magnitude of the change.
