Description: 'Slack' <http://slack.com/> provides a service for teams to
    collaborate by sharing messages, images, links, files and more. Functions are provided
    that make it possible to interact with the 'Slack' platform 'API'. When
    you need to share information or data from R, rather than resort to copy/
    paste in e-mails or other services like 'Skype' <http://www.skype.com/>, you
    can use this package to send well-formatted output from multiple R objects and
    expressions to all teammates at the same time with little effort. You can also
    send images from the current graphics device, R objects (as RData), and upload
    files.
