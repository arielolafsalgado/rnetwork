Description: Slackr contains functions that make it possible to
    interact with Slack.com messaging platform. When you need to share
    information/data from R, rather than resort to copy/paste in e-mails
    or other services like Skype, you can use this package to send
    well-formatted output from multiple R objects and expressions
    to all teammates at the same time with little effort. You can also
    send images from the current graphics device, R objects (as RData),
    and upload files.
