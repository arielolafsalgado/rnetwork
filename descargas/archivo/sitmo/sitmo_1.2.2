Description: Provided within is a high quality and fast PPRNG that is able to be used in an 'OpenMP' parallel
    environment compiled under either C++98 or C++11. The objective of this package release is to consolidate
    the distribution of the 'sitmo' library on CRAN by enabling others to link to the 'sitmo' header file instead 
    of including a copy of 'sitmo' within their individual package. Lastly, the package contains example 
    implementations using 'sitmo' and three accompanying vignette that provide additional information.
