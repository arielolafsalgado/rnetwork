Description: Provides comprehensive functionalities for causal modeling with Coincidence Analysis (CNA), which is a configurational comparative method of causal data analysis that was first introduced in Baumgartner (2009) <doi:10.1177/0049124109339369>. CNA is related to Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), but contrary to the latter, it is custom-built for uncovering causal structures with multiple outcomes. While previous versions have only been capable of processing dichotomous variables, the current version generalizes CNA for multi-value and continuous variables whose values are interpreted as membership scores in fuzzy sets.
