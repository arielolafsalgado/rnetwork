Description: Provides S4 classes and methods for reading and manipulating aligned DNA sequences, supporting an indel coding methods (only simple indel coding method is available in the current version), showing base substitutions and indels, calculating absolute pairwise distances between DNA sequences, and inferring haplotypes from DNA sequences or user provided absolute character difference matrix.  This package also includes S4 classes and methods for estimating genealogical relationships among haplotypes using statistical parsimony.
