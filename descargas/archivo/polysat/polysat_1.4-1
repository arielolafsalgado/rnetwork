Description: A collection of tools to handle microsatellite data of
 any ploidy (and samples of mixed ploidy) where allele copy number is not
 known in partially heterozygous genotypes.  It can import and export data in
 ABI 'GeneMapper', 'Structure', 'ATetra', 'Tetrasat'/'Tetra', 'GenoDive', 'SPAGeDi',
 'POPDIST', 'STRand', and binary presence/absence formats.  It can calculate 
 pairwise distances between individuals using a stepwise mutation model or 
 infinite alleles model, with or without taking ploidies and allele frequencies 
 into account.  These distances can be used for the calculation of clonal 
 diversity statistics or used for further analysis in R.  Allelic diversity 
 statistics are also available.  polysat can assist the user in estimating the 
 ploidy of samples, and it can estimate allele frequencies in 
 populations, calculate pairwise Fst values based on those frequencies, and 
 export allele frequencies to 'SPAGeDi' and 'adegenet'.  Functions are also 
 included for assigning alleles to isoloci in cases where one pair of 
 microsatellite primers amplifies alleles from two or more independently 
 segregating isoloci.
