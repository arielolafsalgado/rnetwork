Title: Formalized Plots for Self-Describing Data
Version: 0.2.1
Author: Tim Bergsma
Maintainer: Tim Bergsma <bergsmat@gmail.com>
Description: Creates fully-annotated plots with minimum guidance.
 Since the data is self-describing, less effort is needed for
 creating the plot. Generally expects data of class folded
 (see 'fold' package). If attributes GUIDE and LABEL are present, 
 they will be used to create formal axis labels. Several aesthetics 
 are supported, such as reference lines, unity lines, smooths, and 
 log transformations.
