Description: Designs plots in terms of core structure.  See 'example(metaplot)'.
 Primary arguments are (unquoted) column names; order and type (numeric or not)
 dictate the resulting plot.  Specify any y variables, x variable, any groups variable,
 and any conditioning variables to metaplot() to generate density plots, boxplots, 
 scatterplots, scatterplot matrices, or conditioned plots. Use multiplot() to arrange
 plots in grids. Wherever present, scalar column attributes 'label' and 'guide' are 
 honored, producing fully annotated plots with minimal effort. Attribute 'guide' 
 is typically units, but may be encoded() to provide interpretations of categorical 
 values (see '?encode').  Utility unpack() transforms scalar column attributes to row 
 values and pack() does the reverse, supporting tool-neutral storage of metadata along 
 with primary data. The package supports customizable aesthetics such as such as reference 
 lines, unity lines, smooths, log transformation, and linear fits. Compact syntax and 
 integrated metadata promote workflow scalability.
