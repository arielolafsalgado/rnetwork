Title: Formalized Plots with Systematic Metadata
Version: 0.2.7
Author: Tim Bergsma

Description: Designs plots in terms of core structure.  See 'example(metaplot)'.
 Primary arguments are (unquoted) column names; order and type (numeric or not)
 dictate the resulting plot.  Specify any y variables, x variable, any groups variable,
 and any conditioning variables to metaplot() to generate density plots, boxplots, 
 scatterplots, scatterplot matrices, or conditioned plots.  Honors scalar column 
 attributes 'label' and 'guide' where present to produce fully annotated plots 
 using concise syntax. Attribute 'guide' is typically units, but may be encoded() 
 to provide interpretations of categorical values (see 'encode' package).  Utility 
 unpack() transforms scalar column attributes to row values and pack() does the 
 reverse, supporting tool-neutral storage of metadata along with primary data. 
 Supports customizable aesthetics such as such as reference lines, unity lines, 
 smooths, log transformation, and linear fits. Compact syntax and isolated metadata
 promote workflow scalability.
