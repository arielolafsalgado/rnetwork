Description: Implementation of the remote effects spatial process (RESP) model for teleconnection.  The RESP model is a geostatistical model that allows a spatially-referenced variable (like average precipitation) to be influenced by covariates defined on a remote domain (like sea surface temperatures).  The RESP model is introduced in Hewitt et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/env.2523>.  Sample code for working with the RESP model is available at <https://jmhewitt.github.io/research/resp_example>.
