Title: Estimation and Prediction for Remote Effects Spatial Process
        Models

Description: Implementation of the remote effects spatial process (RESP) model for teleconnection.  The RESP model is a geostatistical model that allows a spatially-referenced variable (like average precipitation) to be influenced by covariates defined on a remote domain (like sea surface temperatures).  The RESP model is introduced in Hewitt et al. (2018) <arXiv:1612.06303>.  Sample code for working with the RESP model is available at <https://jmhewitt.github.io/research/resp_example>.
