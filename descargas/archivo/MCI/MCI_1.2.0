Description: The Multiplicative Competitive Interaction (MCI) Model by Nakanishi & Cooper (1974) <DOI:10.2307/3151146> is an econometric model for analyzing market shares and/or market areas and is closely related to the Huff model. The functions in this package include fitting the MCI model, MCI shares simulations, the log-centering transformation of MCI datasets, creation of interaction matrices and tools for data preparation. Additionally, the package provides applications for the Huff model, including a non-linear fitting algorithm.
