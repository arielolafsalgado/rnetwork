Description: Bindings to 'FFmpeg' <http://www.ffmpeg.org/> AV library for working with audio 
    and video in R. Generate high quality videos files by capturing images from the R graphics
    device combined with custom audio stream. Also offers tools to convert between countless 
    audio / video formats, or convert images to video and vice versa. This package interfaces
    directly to the C API and does not require any command line utilities.
