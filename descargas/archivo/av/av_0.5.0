Description: Bindings to 'FFmpeg' <http://www.ffmpeg.org/> AV library for working with 
    audio and video in R. Generates high quality video from images or R graphics with 
    custom audio. Also offers high performance tools for reading raw audio, creating
    'spectrograms', and converting between countless audio / video formats. This package 
    interfaces directly to the C API and does not require any command line utilities.
