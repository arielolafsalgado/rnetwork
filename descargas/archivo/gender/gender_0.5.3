Description: Infers state-recorded gender categories from first names and dates of birth using historical
    datasets. By using these datasets instead of lists of male and female names,
    this package is able to more accurately infer the gender of a name, and it
    is able to report the probability that a name was male or female. GUIDELINES:
    This method must be used cautiously and responsibly. Please be sure to see the
    guidelines and warnings about usage in the 'README' or the package documentation.
