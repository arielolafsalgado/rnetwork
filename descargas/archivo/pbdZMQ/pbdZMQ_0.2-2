Description: 'ZeroMQ' is a well-known library for high-performance
    asynchronous messaging in scalable, distributed applications.  This
    package provides high level R wrapper functions to easily utilize
    'ZeroMQ'. We mainly focus on interactive client/server programming
    frameworks. For convenience, a minimal 'ZeroMQ' library (4.1.0 rc1)
    is shipped with 'pbdZMQ', which can be used if no system installation
    of 'ZeroMQ' is available.  A few wrapper functions compatible with
    'rzmq' are also provided.
SystemRequirements: Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows, or ZeroMQ library >=
        4.0.4. Solaris 10 needs ZeroMQ library 4.0.7 and OpenCSW.
