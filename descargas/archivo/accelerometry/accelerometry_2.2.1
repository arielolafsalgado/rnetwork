Description: This package contains a collection of functions that perform operations on time-series accelerometer data, such as identify non-wear time, flag minutes that are part of an activity bout, and find the maximum 10-minute average count value. The functions are generally very flexible, allowing for a variety of algorithms to be implemented. Most of the functions are written in C++ and therefore execute very quickly.
