Description: A method for automatic detection of peaks in noisy periodic and
    quasi-periodic signals. This method, called automatic multiscale-based peak
    detection (AMPD), is based on the calculation and analysis of the local maxima
    scalogram, a matrix comprising the scale-dependent occurrences of local maxima.
