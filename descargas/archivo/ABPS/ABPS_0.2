Description: An implementation of the Abnormal Blood Profile Score (ABPS,
    part of the Athlete Biological Passport program of the World Anti-Doping
    Agency), which combines several blood parameters into a single score in
    order to detect blood doping (Sottas et al. (2006)
    <doi:10.2202/1557-4679.1011>). The package also contains functions to
    calculate other scores used in anti-doping programs, such as the
    OFF-score (Gore et al. (2003) <http://www.haematologica.org/content/88/3/333>),
    as well as example data.
