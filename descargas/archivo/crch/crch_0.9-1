Description: Different approaches to censored or truncated regression with 
  conditional heteroscedasticity are provided. First, continuous 
  distributions can be used for the (right and/or left censored or truncated)
  response with separate linear predictors for the mean and variance. 
  Second, cumulative link models for ordinal data
  (obtained by interval-censoring continuous data) can be employed for
  heteroscedastic extended logistic regression (HXLR). In the latter type of
  models, the intercepts depend on the thresholds that define the intervals.
