Title: Tools To Generate Vector Time Series
Type: Package
Author: Emanuele Cordano
Description: A method 'generate' is implemented in this package for the random
    generation of vector time series according to models obtained by 'RMAWGEN',

    algorithms of the RMAWGEN package for the analysis and generation of any
    environmental vector time series.
