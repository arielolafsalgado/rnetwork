Description: The QRI_func() function performs quantile regression analysis using age and sex as predictors to calculate the Quantile Regression Index (QRI) score for each individualâ€™s regional brain imaging metrics and then averages across the regional scores to generate an average tissue specific score for each subject. The QRI_plot() is used to plot QRI and generate the normative curves for individual measurements.
