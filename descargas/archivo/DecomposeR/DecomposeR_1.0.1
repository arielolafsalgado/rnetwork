Description: Tools to apply Ensemble Empirical Mode 
    Decomposition (EEMD) for cyclostratigraphy purposes. Mainly: a new 
    algorithm, extricate, that performs EEMD in seconds, a linear interpolation 
    algorithm  using the greatest rational common divisor of depth or time, 
    different algorithms to compute instantaneous amplitude, frequency and  
    ratios of frequencies, and functions to verify and visualise the outputs.
    The functions were developed during the CRASH project (Checking the 
    Reproducibility of Astrochronology in the Hauterivian). When using for
