Package: lpdensity
Title: Local Polynomial Density Estimation and Inference
Version: 0.1
Author: Matias D. Cattaneo, Michael Jansson, Xinwei Ma

Description: Without imposing stringent distributional assumptions or shape restrictions, nonparametric density estimation has been popular in economics and other social sciences for counterfactual analysis, program evaluation, and policy recommendations. This package implements a novel density estimator based on local polynomial regression, documented in Cattaneo, Jansson and Ma (2017): lpdensity() to construct local polynomial based density (and derivatives) estimator; lpbwdensity() to perform data-driven bandwidth selection; and lpdensity.plot() for density plot with robust confidence interval.
