Title: Monotonic Optimal Binning
Version: 0.1.0
Description: Generate the monotonic binning and
    perform the woe (weight of evidence) transformation for the logistic regression
    used in the consumer credit scorecard development. The woe transformation is a piecewise
    transformation that is linear to the log odds. For a numeric variable, all of its monotonic 
    functional transformations will converge to the same woe transformation.
