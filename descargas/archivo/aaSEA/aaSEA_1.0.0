Description: Given a protein multiple sequence alignment, it is daunting task to assess the effects of substitutions along sequence length. 'aaSEA' package is intended to help researchers to rapidly analyse property changes caused by single, multiple and correlated amino acid substitutions in proteins. Methods for identification of co-evolving positions from multiple sequence alignment are as described in :  Pel√© et al., (2017) <doi:10.4172/2379-1764.1000250>.
