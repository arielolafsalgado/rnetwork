Description: A toolbox in symbolic data framework as a statistical learning and data mining solution for symbolic polygonal data analysis. This study is a new approach in data analysis and it was proposed by 
            Silva et al. (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.knosys.2018.08.009>. The package presents the estimation of main descriptive statistical measures, e.g, mean, covariance, variance, correlation and coefficient of variation. 
            In addition, a method to obtain polygonal data from classical data is presented. Empirical probability distribution function based on symbolic polygonal histogram and a regression model with its main measures are presented.
