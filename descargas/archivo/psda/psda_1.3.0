Description: An implementation of symbolic polygonal data analysis. The package presents the estimation of main descriptive statistical measures, e.g, mean, covariance, variance, correlation and coefficient of variation. 
            In addition, a method to obtain polygonal data from classical data is presented. Empirical probability distribution function based on 
            polygonal histogram and a regression model with its main measures are presented.
