Description: An implementation of symbolic polygonal data analysis. The package presents the estimation of main descriptive statistical measures, e.g, mean, covariance, variance, correlation and coefficient of variation. 
            In addition, transformation of the data in polygons. Empirical probability distribution function based on 
            polygonal histogram and regression models are presented.
