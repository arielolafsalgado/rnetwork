Description: Prognostic Enrichment is a clinical trial strategy of evaluating an intervention in a patient population with a higher rate of the unwanted event than the broader patient population (R. Temple (2010) <DOI:10.1038/clpt.2010.233>). A higher event rate translates to a lower sample size for the clinical trial, which can have both practical and ethical advantages. This package is a tool to help evaluate biomarkers for prognostic enrichment of clinical trials.
