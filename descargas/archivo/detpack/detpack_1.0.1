Title: Density Estimation and Random Number Generation with
        Distribution Element Trees
Version: 1.0.1
Author: Daniel Meyer
Maintainer: Daniel Meyer <meyerda@ethz.ch>
Description: Density estimation for possibly large data sets and conditional/unconditional random number generation with distribution element trees. The function 'det.construct' translates a dataset into a distribution element tree. To evaluate the probability density based on a previously computed tree at arbitrary query points, the function 'det.query' is available. The functions 'det1' and 'det2' provide density estimation and plotting for one- and two-dimensional datasets. Conditional/unconditional smooth bootstrapping from an available distribution element tree, can be performed by 'det.rnd'. For more details on distribution element trees see: Meyer, D.W. (2016) <arXiv:1610.00345> or Meyer, D.W., Statistics and Computing (2017) <doi:10.1007/s11222-017-9751-9> and Meyer, D.W. (2017) <arXiv:1711.04632>.
