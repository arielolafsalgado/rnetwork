Description: Efficient algorithm for solving ultra-sparse
		regularized regression models using a variational
		Bayes algorithm with a spike (l0) prior.  Algorithm
		is solved on a path, with coordinate updates, and is
		capable of generating very sparse models.  There are
		very general model diagnostics for controling type-1
		error included in this package.
