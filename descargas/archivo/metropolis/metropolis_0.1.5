Description: Learning and using the Metropolis algorithm for
    Bayesian fitting of a generalized linear model. The package vignette
    includes examples of hand-coding a logistic model using several
    variants of the Metropolis algorithm. The package also contains R
    functions for simulating posterior distributions of Bayesian
    generalized linear model parameters using guided, adaptive,
    guided-adaptive and random walk Metropolis algorithms. The random walk
    Metropolis algorithm was originally described in Metropolis et al
    (1953) <doi:10.1063/1.1699114>.
