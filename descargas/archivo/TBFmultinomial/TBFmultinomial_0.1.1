Description: Extends the test-based Bayes factor (TBF) methodology to multinomial regression models and discrete time-to-event models with competing risks. The TBF methodology has been well developed and implemented for the generalised linear model [Held et al. (2015) <doi:10.1214/14-STS510>] and for the Cox model [Held et al. (2016) <doi:10.1002/sim.7089>].
