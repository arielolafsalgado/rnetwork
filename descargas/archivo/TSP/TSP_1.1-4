Description: Basic infrastructure and some algorithms for the traveling
    salesperson problem (also traveling salesman problem; TSP).
    The package provides some simple algorithms and
    an interface to the Concorde TSP solver and its implementation of the
    Chained-Lin-Kernighan heuristic. Concorde
    itself is not included in the package and has to be obtained separately
    from http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html.
