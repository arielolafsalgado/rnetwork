Description: Make acoustic cues to use with the R packages 'ndl' or 'ndl2'. The package implements functions used
              in the PLoS ONE paper:
              Denis Arnold, Fabian Tomaschek, Konstantin Sering, Florence Lopez, and R. Harald Baayen (2017).
              Words from spontaneous conversational speech can be recognized with human-like accuracy by 
              an error-driven learning algorithm that discriminates between meanings straight from smart 
              acoustic features, bypassing the phoneme as recognition unit.  PLoS ONE 12(4):e0174623

              More details can be found in the paper and the supplement.
