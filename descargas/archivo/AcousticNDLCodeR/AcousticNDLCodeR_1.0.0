Description: Make acoustic cues to use with the R packages 'ndl' or 'ndl2'. The package implements functions used
              in the PLOS ONE paper:
              Denis Arnold, Fabian Tomaschek, Konstantin Sering, Florence Lopez, and R. Harald Baayen (accepted).
              Words from spontaneous conversational speech can be recognized with human-like accuracy by 
              an error-driven learning algorithm that discriminates between meanings straight from smart 
              acoustic features, bypassing the phoneme as recognition unit. PLOS ONE
              More details can be found in the paper and the supplement.
              'ndl' is available on CRAN. 'ndl2' is available by request from <konstantin.sering@uni-tuebingen.de>.
