Description: In the Cramér–Lundberg risk process perturbed by a Wiener
    process, this packages provides approximations to the probability of
    ruin within a finite time horizon.  Currently, there are three methods
    implemented: The first one uses saddlepoint approximation (two
    variants are provided), the second one uses importance sampling and
    the third one is based on the simulation of a dual process.  This last
    method is not very accurate and only given here for completeness.
