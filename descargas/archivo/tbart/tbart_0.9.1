Description: Solves Teitz and Bart's p-median problem - given a set of
    points attempts to find subset of size p such that summed distances of any
    point in the set to the nearest point in p is minimised.  Although
    generally effective, this algorithm does not guarantee that a globally
    optimal subset is found.
