Description: Implements marker-based estimation of heritability when observations on genetically identical replicates are available. These can be either observations on individual plants or plot-level data in a field trial. Heritability can then be estimated using a mixed model for the individual plant or plot data. For comparison, also mixed-model based estimation using genotypic means and estimation of repeatability with ANOVA are implemented. For illustration the package contains several datasets for the model species Arabidopsis thaliana.
