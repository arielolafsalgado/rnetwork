Description: Implementing the Progeny Clustering algorithm, the progenyClust package assesses the clustering stability and identifies the optimal clustering number for a given data matrix. It uses kmeans clustering as default, but can be customized to work with other clustering algorithms and different parameter settings. The package includes one main function progenyClust(), plot and summary methods for progenyClust object, and two example datasets (test and cell) for testing.
