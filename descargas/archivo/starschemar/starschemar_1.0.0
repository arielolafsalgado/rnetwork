Description: Data in multidimensional systems is obtained from 
    operational systems and is transformed to adapt it to the new 
    structure. Frequently, the operations to be performed aim to 
    transform a flat table into a star schema. Transformations can 
    be carried out using professional ETL (extract, transform and 
    load) tools or tools intended for data transformation for end 
    users. With the tools mentioned, this transformation can be 
    carried out, but it requires a lot of work. The main objective 
    this package is to define transformations that allow obtaining 
    star schemas from flat tables easily. In addition, it includes 
    basic data cleaning operations and incremental data refresh 
    operations, adapted to this context.
