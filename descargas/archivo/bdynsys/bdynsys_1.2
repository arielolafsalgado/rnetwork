Description: The package bdynsys for panel/longitudinal data combines methods to model 
             changes in up to four indicators over times as a function of the indicators
             themselves and up to three predictors using ordinary differential equations 
             (ODEs) with polynomial terms that allow to model complex and nonlinear 
             effects. A Bayesian model selection approach is implemented. The package 
             provides also visualisation tools to plot phase portraits of the dynamic 
             system, showing the complex co-evolution of two indicators over time with the
             possibility to highlight trajectories for specified entities (e.g. countries, 
             individuals). Furthermore the visualisation tools allow for making 
             predictions of the trajectories of specified entities with respect to the 
             indicators.
