Description: This tool computes the probability of detection (POD) curve and the limit of detection (LOD), i.e. the number of copies of the target DNA sequence required to ensure a 95 % probability of detection (LOD95). Other quantiles of the LOD can be specified.
    This is a reimplementation of the mathematical-statistical modelling of the validation of qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods within a single laboratory as provided by the commercial tool 'PROLab' <http://quodata.de/>. The modelling itself has been described by Uhlig et al. (2015) <doi:10.1007/s00769-015-1112-9>.
