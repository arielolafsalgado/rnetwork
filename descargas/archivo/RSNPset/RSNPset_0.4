Description: RSNPset is an implementation of the use of efficient score statistics
  in genome-wide SNP set analysis with complex traits. The package provides three standard
  score statistics (Cox, binomial, and Gaussian) but is easily extensible to include
  others. Code implementing the inferential procedure is primarily written in C++ and
  utilizes parallelization of the analysis to reduce runtime. A supporting function offers
  simple computation of observed, permutation, and FWER and FDR adjusted p-values.
