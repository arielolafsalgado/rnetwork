Description: R interface to PortfolioEffect cloud service for backtesting
    high frequency trading (HFT) strategies, intraday portfolio analysis 
    and optimization. Includes auto-calibrating model pipeline for market
    microstructure noise, risk factors, price jumps/outliers, tail risk 
    (high-order moments) and price fractality (long memory). Constructed 
    portfolios could use client-side market data or access HF intraday price
    history for all major US Equities. See https://www.portfolioeffect.com/
    for more information on the PortfolioEffect high frequency portfolio 
    analytics platform.
