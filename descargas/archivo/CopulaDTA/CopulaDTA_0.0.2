Description: Modelling of sensitivity and specificity on their natural scale
    using copula based bivariate beta-binomial distribution to yield marginal mean sensitivity
    and specificity. The intrinsic negative correlation between sensitivity and
    specificity is modelled using a copula function. A forest plot can be obtained
    for categorical covariates or for the model with intercept only.
