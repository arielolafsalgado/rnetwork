Description: Functions for performing Bayesian `similarity regression',
    specialised for modelling the association between a HPO-encoded phenotype
    and binary genotype. A `no association' model is compared with one in which
    the log odds of having a rare genotype is linked to the semantic similarity
    between patient phenotype and a latent characteristic phenotype. The method
    estimates the probability of an association together with an HPO-coded phenotype
    characteristic of the disease.
