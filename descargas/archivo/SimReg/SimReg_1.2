Description: Functions for performing Bayesian `similarity regression', adapted to model the association between an HPO-encoded patient phenotype and binary genotype. A `no association' model is compared with one in which the log odds of having a rare genotype is linked to the semantic similarity between patient phenotype and a latent characteristic phenotype. The method estimates the probability of an association together with an HPO-coded phenotype characteristic of the disease.
