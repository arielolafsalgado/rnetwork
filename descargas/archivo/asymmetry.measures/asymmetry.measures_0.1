Description: Provides functions and examples for the weak and strong density asymmetry measures in the articles: "A measure of asymmetry", Patil, Patil and Bagkavos (2012) <doi:10.1007/s00362-011-0401-6> and "A measure of asymmetry based on a new necessary and sufficient condition for symmetry", Patil, Bagkavos and Wood (2014) <doi:10.1007/s13171-013-0034-z>. The measures provided here are useful for quantifying the asymmetry of the shape of a density of a random variable. The package facilitates implementation of the measures which are applicable in a variety of fields including e.g. probability theory, statistics and economics.
