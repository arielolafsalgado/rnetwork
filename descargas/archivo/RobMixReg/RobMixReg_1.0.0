Description: Finite mixture models are a popular technique for modelling unobserved heterogeneity or to approximate general distribution functions in a semi-parametric way. They are used in a lot of different areas such as astronomy, biology, economics, marketing or medicine.
             This package is the implementation of popular robust mixture regression methods based on different algorithms including: fleximix, finite mixture models and latent class regression; CTLERob, component-wise adaptive trimming likelihood estimation; mixbi, bi-square estimation; mixL, Laplacian distribution; mixt, t-distribution; TLE, trimmed likelihood estimation.
             The implemented algorithms includes:  CTLERob stands for Component-wise adaptive Trimming Likelihood Estimation based mixture regression; mixbi stands for mixture regression based on bi-square estimation; mixLstands for mixture regression based on Laplacian distribution; TLE stands for Trimmed Likelihood Estimation based mixture regression. For more detail of the algorithms, please refer to below references.
