Description: Fits latent class analysis (LCA) including group variable and covariates. 
   The group variable can be handled either by multilevel LCA described in Vermunt (2003) <DOI:10.1111/j.0081-1750.2003.t01-1-00131.x> or standard LCA at each level of group variable.
   The covariates can be incorporated in the form of logistic regression (Bandeen-Roche et al. (1997) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.1997.10473658>).
