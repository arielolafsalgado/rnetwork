Description: Supports the generation of maps based on the results from 
     'SaTScan' (TM) cluster analysis.
     The package handles mapping of Spatial and Spatial-Time analysis using
     the discrete Poisson, Bernoulli, and exponential models of case data generating
     cluster and location ('GIS') records containing observed, expected and observed/expected
     ratio for U. S. states (and DC), counties or census tracts of individual 
     states based on the U. S. 'FIPS' codes for state, county and census tracts 
     (locations) using 2000 or 2010 Census areas, 'FIPS' codes, and boundary data.
     'satscanMapper' uses the 'SeerMapper' package for the boundary data and 
     mapping of locations.  Not all of the 'SaTScan' (TM) analysis and models generate
     the observed, expected and observed/expected ratio values for the clusters and 
     locations.
     The user can map the observed/expected ratios for locations 
     (states, counties, or census tracts) for each cluster with a p-value less than 0.05 
     or a user specified p-value.  
     The locations are categorized and colored based on either the cluster's Observed/Expected 
     ratio or the locations' Observed/Expected ratio. 
     The place names are provided for each census tract using data from 'NCI', the 'HUD' crossover 
     tables (Tract to Zip code) as of December, 2013, the USPS Zip code 5 database for 1999, 
     and manual look ups on the USPS.gov web site.
