Description: Takes as its input an array of IP addresses and the user's X-Key, passes these to <https://iphub.info/>, and returns a dataframe with the ip (used for merging), country code, country name, asn, isp, block, and hostname.
    Especially important in this is the variable "block", which gives a score indicating whether the IP address is likely from a server farm and should be excluded from the data. It is codes 0 if the IP is residential/unclassified (i.e. safe IP), 1 if the IP is non-residential IP (hostping provider, proxy, etc. -- should likely be excluded), and 2 for non-residential and residential IPs (more stringent, may flag innocent respondents).
    The recommendation from <https://iphub.info/> is to block or exclude those who score block = 1.
