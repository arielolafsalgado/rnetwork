Description: A collection of functions for data manipulation, plotting and statistical computing, to use separately or with the book "Visual Statistics. Use R!": Shipunov (2019) <http://ashipunov.info/shipunov/software/r/r-en.htm>.
 Most useful functions are probably Bclust(), Jclust() and BootA() which bootstrap hierarchical clustering; Recode...() which multiple recode in a fast, flexible and simple way; Misclass() which outputs confusion matrix even if classes are not concerted;
 Overlap() which calculates overlaps of convex hulls from any projection; and Pleiad() which is fast and flexible correlogram. In fact, there are much more useful functions, please see documentation.
