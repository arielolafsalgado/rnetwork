Description: This package takes data on organism isotopes and fits a
        Bayesian model to their dietary habits based upon a Gaussian
        likelihood with a mixture dirichlet-distributed prior on the
        mean. See siardemo() for an example. The latest version
        includes SiBER metrics. Version 4.1.1 contains a bug fix to the
        function standard.ellipse
