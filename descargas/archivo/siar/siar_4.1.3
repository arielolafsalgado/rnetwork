Description: This package takes data on organism isotopes and fits a Bayesian model to their dietary habits based upon a Gaussian likelihood with a mixture dirichlet-distributed prior on the mean. It also includes SiBER metrics. See siardemo() for an example. Version 4.1.2 contains bug fixes to allow more than isotope numbers other than 2.
