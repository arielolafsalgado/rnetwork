Description: A toolkit for all URL-handling needs, including encoding and decoding,
    parsing, parameter extraction and modification. All functions are
    designed to be both fast and entirely vectorised. It is intended to be
    useful for people dealing with web-related datasets, such as server-side
    logs, although may be useful for other situations involving large sets of
    URLs.
