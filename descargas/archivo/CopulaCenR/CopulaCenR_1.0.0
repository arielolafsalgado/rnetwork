Title: Copula-Based Regression Models for Bivariate Censored Data
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Tao Sun, Ying Ding
Maintainer: Tao Sun <tao.sun@pitt.edu>
Description: Copula-based regression models for bivariate censored data, including 
 bivariate right-censored data and bivariate interval-censored data. Currently 
 supports Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, Joe, AMH and Copula2 copula models. For 
 marginal models, it supports parametric (Weibull, Loglogistic, Gompertz), 
 weakly-parametric piecewise-constant hazards (only for bivariate right-censored)
 and semiparametric transformation (only for bivariate interval-censored data) 
 models. Includes methods for convenient prediction and plotting. Also provides 
 a bivariate time-to-event simulation function. Method details can be found in 
 Sun et.al. (2018) < doi:10.1007/s10985-018-09459-5> and
