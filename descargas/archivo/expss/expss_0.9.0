Description: Package computes and displays tables with support for 'SPSS'-style 
        labels, multiple and nested banners, weights, multiple-response variables 
        and significance testing. There are facilities for nice output of tables 
        in 'knitr', 'Shiny', '*.xlsx' files, R and 'Jupyter' notebooks. Methods 
        for labelled variables add value labels support to base R functions and to 
        some functions from other packages. Additionally, the package brings 
        popular data transformation functions from 'SPSS' Statistics and 'Excel': 
        'RECODE', 'COUNT', 'COMPUTE', 'DO IF', 'COUNTIF', 'VLOOKUP' and etc. 
        These functions are very useful for data processing in marketing research 
        surveys. Package intended to help people to move data 
        processing from 'Excel' and 'SPSS' to R.
