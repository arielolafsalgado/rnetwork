Description: Package provides tabulation functions with support for 'SPSS'-style 
        labels, multiple / nested banners, weights, multiple-response variables 
        and significance testing. There are facilities for nice output of tables 
        in 'knitr', R notebooks, 'Shiny' and 'Jupyter' notebooks. Proper methods 
        for labelled variables add value labels support to base R functions and to 
        some functions from other packages. Additionally, the package offers 
        useful functions for data processing in marketing research / social 
        surveys - popular data transformation functions from 'SPSS' Statistics 
        ('RECODE', 'COUNT', 'COMPUTE', 'DO IF', etc.) and 'Excel' ('COUNTIF', 
        'VLOOKUP', etc.). Package is intended to help people to move data 
        processing from 'Excel'/'SPSS' to R.
