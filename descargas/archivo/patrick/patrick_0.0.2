Title: Parameterized Unit Testing
Version: 0.0.2
Author: Michael Quinn <msquinn@google.com>
Maintainer: Michael Quinn <msquinn@google.com>
Description: This is an extension of the 'testthat' package that
    lets you add parameters to your unit tests. Parameterized unit tests
    are often easier to read and more reliable, since they follow the DNRY
    (do not repeat yourself) rule.
