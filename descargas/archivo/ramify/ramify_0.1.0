Description: Additional matrix functionality for R. Includes a wrapper to the 
  base matrix function that extends its functionality by allowing
  matrices to be created from character strings and lists. A number of 
  convenience functions have also been added for users more familiar with other
  scientific languages like Julia, MATLAB/Octave, or Python.
