Description: Additional matrix functionality for R including: (1) wrappers
  for the base matrix function that allows matrices to be created from character 
  strings and lists (the former is especially useful for creating block 
  matrices), (ii) better default printing of large matrices, and (iii) a number 
  of convenience functions for users more familiar with other scientific 
  languages like Julia, Matlab/Octave, or Python.
