Title: Simulate Probabilistic Long-Term Effects in Models with Temporal
        Dependence
Description: Calculates and depicts probabilistic long-term effects
    in binary models with temporal dependence variables. The package performs
    two tasks. First, it calculates the change in the probability of the event
    occurring given a change in a theoretical variable. Second, it calculates
    the rolling difference in the future probability of the event for two
    scenarios: one where the event occurred at a given time and one where the
    event does not occur. The package is consistent with the recent movement to
    depict meaningful and easy-to-interpret quantities of interest with the
    requisite measures of uncertainty. It is the first to make it easy for
    researchers to interpret short- and long-term effects of explanatory
    variables in binary autoregressive models, which can have important
    implications for the correct interpretation of these models.
