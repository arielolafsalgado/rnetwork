Description: The chipPCR package is a toolkit of functions to pre-process
    amplification curve data. Amplification data can be obtained from
    conventional PCR reactions or isothermal amplification reactions. The
    package contains functions to normalize and baseline amplification curves,
    a routine to detect the start of an amplification reaction, several
    smoothers for amplification data, a function to distinguish positive and
    negative amplification reactions and a function to determine the
    amplification efficiency. The smoothers are based on LOWESS, moving
    average, cubic splines, Savitzky-Golay and others. In addition the first
    approximate approximate derivative maximum (FDM) and second approximate
    derivative maximum (SDM) can be calculated by a 5-point-stencil as
    quantification points from real-time amplification curves. chipPCR contains
    data sets of experimental nucleic acid amplification systems including the
    VideoScan HCU and a capillary convective PCR (ccPCR) system. The
    amplification data were generated by helicase dependent amplification (HDA)
    or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) under various temperature conditions. As
    detection system intercalating dyes (EvaGreen, SYBR Green) and hydrolysis
    probes (TaqMan) were used. The latest source code is available via:
