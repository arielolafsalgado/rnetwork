Description: 
    Provides functions for constructing near-optimal generalized full matching.
    Generalized full matching is an extension of the original full matching method
    to situations with more intricate study designs. The package is made with
    large data sets in mind and derives matches more than an order of magnitude
    quicker than other methods.
