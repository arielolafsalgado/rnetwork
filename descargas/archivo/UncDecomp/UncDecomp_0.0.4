Description: If a procedure consists of several stages and there are several scenarios that can be selected for each stage,
	uncertainty of the procedure can be decomposed by stages or scenarios.
	cum_uncertainty() is used to decompose uncertainty based on the cumulative uncertainty.
	stage_uncertainty() and scenario_uncertainty() is used to decompose uncertainty based on the second order interaction ANOVA model.
	In stage_uncertainty() and scenario_uncertainty(), the uncertainty from interaction effect from two stages is distributed equally to each stage.
