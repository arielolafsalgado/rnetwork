Description: Loads and displays images, selectively masks specified background
  colors, bins pixels by color using either data-dependent or automatically
  generated color bins, quantitatively measures color similarity among images
  using one of several distance metrics for comparing pixel color clusters, and 
  clusters images by object color similarity. Originally written for use with
  organism coloration (reef fish color diversity, butterfly mimicry, etc), but
  easily applicable for any image set.
