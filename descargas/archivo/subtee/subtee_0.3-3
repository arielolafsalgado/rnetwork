Description: Naive and adjusted treatment effect estimation for subgroups. Model 
  averaging and bagging are proposed to address the problem of selection bias in
  treatment effect estimates for subgroups. The package can be used for all 
  commonly encountered type of outcomes in clinical trials (continuous, binary, 
  survival, count). Additional functions are provided to build the subgroup 
  variables to be used and to plot the results using forest plots.
