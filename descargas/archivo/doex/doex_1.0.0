Description: Contains several one-way heteroscedastic ANOVA tests such as Alexander-Govern, Alvandi et al. Generalized F, Approximate F, Box F, Brown-Forsythe, B2, Cochran F, Fiducial Approach, Generalized F, Johansen F, Modified Brown-Forsythe, Modified Welch, One-Stage, One-Stage Range, Parametric Bootstrap, Permutation F, Scott-Smith, Welch and Welch-Aspin test. These tests are used to test the equality of group means under unequal variance. Furthermore, a modified version of Generalized F-test is improved to test the equality of non-normal group means under unequal variances. Tukey's bi-square estimators, one-step Tukey's bi-square estimators, Andrew's wave estimator, one-step Andrew's wave estimators, Huber's M-estimators are used to modify Generalized F-test.
