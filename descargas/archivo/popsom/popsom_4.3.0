Description: A self-organizing map package with three distinguishing features: 
  (1) Automatic cluster centroid detection and visualization using starbursts 
  (2) Convergence index, a statistical quality measure based on the linear combination of map embedding and estimated topographic accuracy
  (3) A very efficient stochastic training algorithm based on ideas from tensor algebra.
