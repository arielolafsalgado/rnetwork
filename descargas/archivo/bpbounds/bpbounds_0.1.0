Description: Implementation of the nonparametric bounds for the average causal 
    effect under an instrumental variable model by Balke and Pearl (Bounds on 
    Treatment Effects from Studies with Imperfect Compliance, JASA, 1997, 92, 
    439, 1171-1176). The package can calculate bounds for a binary outcome, a 
    binary treatment/phenotype, and an instrument with either 2 or 3 
    categories. The package implements bounds for situations where these 3 
    variables are measured in the same dataset (trivariate data) or where the 
    outcome and instrument are measured in one study and the 
    treatment/phenotype and instrument are measured in another study 
    (bivariate data).
