Description: Imputation for the missing count values in accelerometer data. The methodology includes both parametric and semi-parametric multiple imputations under the zero-inflated Poisson lognormal model. This package also provides multiple functions to pre-process the accelerometer data previous to the missing data imputation. These includes detecting wearing and non-wearing time, selecting valid days and subjects, and creating plots.
