Description: Calculate with spectral properties of light sources, materials, cameras, eyes, and scanners.
    Build complex systems from simpler parts using a spectral product algebra. For light sources,
    compute CCT and CRI.  For object colors, compute optimal colors and Logvinenko coordinates.
    Work with the standard CIE illuminants and color matching functions, and read spectra from 
    text files, including CGATS files.  Sample text files, and 4 vignettes are included.
