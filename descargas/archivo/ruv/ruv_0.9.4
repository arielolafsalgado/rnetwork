Title: Detect and Remove Unwanted Variation using Negative Controls
Description: The algorithms in this package attempt to adjust for systematic errors of unknown origin in high-dimensional data.  The algorithms were originally developed for use with genomic data, especially microarray data, but may be useful with other types of high-dimensional data as well.  The algorithms included in this package are RUV-2, RUV-4, RUV-inv, and RUV-rinv, along with various supporting algorithms.  These algorithms were proposed by Gagnon-Bartsch and Speed (2012), and by Gagnon-Bartsch, Jacob and Speed (2013).  The algorithms require the user to specifiy a set of negative control variables, as described in the references.
