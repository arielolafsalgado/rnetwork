Description: Implements novel nonparametric approaches to address
    biases and confounding when comparing treatments or exposures in
    observational studies of outcomes. While designed and appropriate for use
    in studies involving medicine and the life sciences, the package can be
    used in other situations involving outcomes with multiple confounders.
    The package implements a family of methods for nonparametric bias
    correction when comparing treatments in cross-sectional, case-control,
    and survival analysis settings, including competing risks with censoring.
    The approach extends to bias-corrected personalized predictions of
    treatment outcome differences, and analysis of heterogeneity of treatment
    effect-sizes across patient subgroups.
