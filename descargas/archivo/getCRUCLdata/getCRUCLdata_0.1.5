Description: Provides functions that automate downloading and importing
    University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit (CRU) CL v. 2.0 climatology
    data into R, facilitates the calculation of minimum temperature and maximum
    temperature and formats the data into a tidy data frame as a tibble or a 
    list of raster stack objects for use in an R session.  CRU CL v. 2.0 data 
    are a gridded climatology of 1961-1990 monthly means released in 2002 and
    cover all land areas (excluding Antarctica) at 10 arcminutes
    (0.1666667 degree) resolution.  For more information see the description of
    the data provided by the University of East Anglia Climate Research Unit,
