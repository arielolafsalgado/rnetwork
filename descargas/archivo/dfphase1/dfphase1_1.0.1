Description: Statistical methods for retrospectively detecting changes in location and/or dispersion of univariate and multivariate variables. Data can be individual (one observation at each instant of time) or subgrouped (more than one observation at each instant of time). Control limits are computed, often using a permutation approach, so that a prescribed false alarm probability is guaranteed  without making any parametric assumptions on the stable (in-control) distribution.
