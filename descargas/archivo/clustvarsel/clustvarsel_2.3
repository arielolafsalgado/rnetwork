Title: Variable Selection for Gaussian Model-Based Clustering
Description: An R package implementing variable selection methodology for Gaussian model-based clustering which allows to find the (locally) optimal subset of variables in a data set that have group/cluster information. A greedy or headlong search can be used, either in a forward-backward or backward-forward direction, with or without sub-sampling at the hierarchical clustering stage for starting MCLUST models. By default the algorithm uses a sequential search, but parallelisation is also available.
