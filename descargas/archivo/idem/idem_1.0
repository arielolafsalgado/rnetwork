Description: In randomized studies involving severely ill patients, functional
    outcomes are often unobserved due to missed clinic visits, premature
    withdrawal or death. It is well known that if these unobserved functional
    outcomes are not handled properly, biased treatment comparisons can be
    produced. In this package, we implement a procedure for comparing treatments
    that is based on the composite endpoint of both the functional outcome and
    survival. The procedure considers missing data imputation with a sensitivity
    analysis strategy to handle the unobserved functional outcomes not due to
    death.
