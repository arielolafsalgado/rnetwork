Title: A Graphical EDA Tool
Description: An automated graphical exploratory data analysis (EDA) tool that introduces: 
  a.) wideplot() graphics for exploring the structure of a dataset through a grid of variables 
      and graphic types. 
  b.) longplot() graphics, which present the entire catalog of available graphics for representing 
      a particular variable using a grid of graphic types and variations on these types.
  c.) plotup() function, which presents a particular graphic for a specific variable of a dataset. 
      The "plotup()" function also makes it possible to obtain the code used to generate the graphic, 
      meaning that the user can adjust its properties as needed.
