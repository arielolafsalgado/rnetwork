Description: This package provides methods of fitting bivariate lines
        in allometry using the major axis (MA) or standardised major
        axis (SMA), and for making inferences about such lines. The
        available methods of inference include confidence intervals and
        one-sample tests for slope and elevation, testing for a common
        slope or elevation amongst several allometric lines,
        constructing a confidence interval for a common slope or
        elevation, and testing for no shift along a common axis,
        amongst several samples.
