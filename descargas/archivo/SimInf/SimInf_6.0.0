Description: Provides an efficient and very flexible framework to
    conduct data-driven epidemiological modeling in realistic large
    scale disease spread simulations. The framework integrates
    infection dynamics in subpopulations as continuous-time Markov
    chains using the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm and
    incorporates available data such as births, deaths and movements
    as scheduled events at predefined time-points. Using C code for
    the numerical solvers and 'OpenMP' (if available) to divide work
    over multiple processors ensures high performance when simulating
    a sample outcome. One of our design goal was to make the package
    extendable and enable usage of the numerical solvers from other R
    extension packages in order to facilitate complex epidemiological
    research. The package contains template models and can be extended
    with user-defined models.
