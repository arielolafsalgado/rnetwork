Description: Functions to convert a page of plots drawn with the 
  graphics package into identical output drawn with the grid package.
  The result looks like the original graphics-based plot, but consists
  of grid grobs and viewports that can then be manipulated with 
  grid functions (e.g., edit grobs and revisit viewports).
