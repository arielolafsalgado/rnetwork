Description: Set of functions for digital simulation of electrochemical processes.
             Each function allows for implicit and explicit solution of the differential equation using methods like Euler, Backwards implicit, Runge Kutta 4 as well as different number of points for derivative approximation. Several electrochemical processes can be simulated such as: Chronoamperometry, Potential Step, Linear Sweep, Cyclic Voltammetry and Cyclic Voltammetry with electrochemical reaction followed by chemical reaction (EC mechanism).
