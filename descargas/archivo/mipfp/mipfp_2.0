Description: An implementation of the iterative proportional fitting (IPFP), 
    maximum likelihood, minimum chi-square and weighted least squares procedures
    for updating a N-dimensional array with respect to given target marginal 
    distributions (which, in turn can be multi-dimensional). The package also
    provides an application of the IPFP to simulate multivariate Bernoulli
    distributions.
