Title: Yield Per Recruit
Description: An implementation of equilibrium-based yield per recruit methods.
    Yield per recruit methods can used to estimate the optimal yield for a fish population.
    The yield can be based on the number of fish caught (or harvested) or 
    biomass caught for all fish or just large (trophy) individuals.
