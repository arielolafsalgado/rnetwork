Description: Nonlinear machine learning tool for classification, clustering
        and dimensionality reduction. It integrates 12 q-kernel functions and 
        14 conditional negative definite kernel functions and includes the 
        q-kernel and conditional negative definite kernel version of 
        density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, 
        spectral clustering, generalized discriminant analysis, principal 
        component analysis, multidimensional scaling, locally linear embedding, 
        Sammon's mapping and t-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.
