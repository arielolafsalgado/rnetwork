Description: The K-sample omnibus non-proportional hazards (KONP) tests are powerful non-parametric tests for comparing K (>=2) hazard functions based on right-censored data (Gorfine, Schlesinger and Hsu, 2019, <arXiv:1901.05739v1>). These tests are consistent against any differences between the hazard functions of the groups. The KONP tests are often more powerful than other existing tests, especially under non-proportional hazard functions.
