Description: Suppose that one can observe bivariate random variables (X, Y) only when X<=Y holds. Data (Xj, Yj), subject to Xj<=Yj, for all j=1,...,n, are called truncated data. For truncated data, several different approaches are implemented for statistical inference on (X, Y), when X and Y are dependent. Also included is truncated data on the number of deaths at each year (1963-1980) for Japanese male centenarians.
