Description: Suppose that one can observe bivariate random variables (X, Y) only when X<=Y holds. Data (Xj, Yj), subject to Xj<=Yj, for all j=1,...,n, are called truncated data. Parametric approach (Emura & Konno 2012 Stat Papers), semiparametric approach (Chaieb et al. 2006 Biometrika; Emura et al. 2011 Sinica; Emura & Murotani 2015 TEST), nonparametric maximum likelihood approach (Emura & Wang 2012 JMVA), and regression approach (Emura & Wang 2015 AISM) are implemented for statistical inference on (X, Y), when X and Y are dependent. Also included is truncated data on the number of deaths at each year (1963-1980) for Japanese male centenarians (Emura & Murotani 2015 TEST).
