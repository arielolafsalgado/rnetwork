Version: 1.2.0
Author: Hannah M. Director, Adrian E. Raftery, and Cecilia M. Bitz

Description: Tools for modeling and correcting biases in sea ice predictions obtained from dynamical models. This package depends on the 'ncdf4' and 'rgeos' R packages. These packages respectively require installing externally from R Unidata's 'NetCDF' library and Geometry Engine - Open Source ('GEOS'). (See the 'rgeos' and 'ncdf4' packages for details.)
