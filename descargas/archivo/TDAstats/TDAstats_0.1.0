Description: A comprehensive toolset for any
    useR conducting topological data analysis, specifically via the
    calculation of persistent homology in a Vietoris-Rips complex.
    The tools this package currently provides can be conveniently split
    into three main sections: (1) calculating persistent homology; (2)
    conducting statistical inference on persistent homology calculations;
    (3) visualizing persistent homology and statistical inference.    
    For a general background on computing persistent homology for
    topological data analysis, see Otter et al. (2017)
    <doi:10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0109-5>.
    To learn more about how the permutation test is used for
    nonparametric statistical inference in topological data analysis,
    read Robinson & Turner (2017) <doi:10.1007/s41468-017-0008-7>.
    To learn more about how TDAstats calculates persistent homology,
    you can visit the GitHub repository for Ripser, the software that
    works behind the scenes at <https://github.com/Ripser/ripser>.
