Description: Interface for working with large matrices stored in files, not in computer memory.
     Supports multiple data types (double, integer, logical and raw) of different sizes (e.g. 4, 2, or 1 byte integers).
     Access to parts of the matrix is done by indexing, exactly as with usual R matrices.
     Supports very large matrices (tested on 1 terabyte matrix), allowing for more than 2^32 rows or columns.
     Cross-platform as the package has R code only, no C/C++.
