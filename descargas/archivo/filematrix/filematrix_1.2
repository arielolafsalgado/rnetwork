Description: Interface for working with large matrices stored in files,
        not in computer memory. Supports multiple non-character
        data types (double, integer, logical and raw) of
        various sizes (e.g. 8 and 4 byte real values).
        Access to parts of the matrix is done by indexing, 
        exactly as with usual R matrices.
        Supports very large matrices.
        Tested on multi-terabyte matrices.
        Allows for more than 2^32 rows or columns.
        Allows for quick addition of extra columns to a filematrix.
        Cross-platform as the package has R code only.
