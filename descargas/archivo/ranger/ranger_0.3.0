Description: A fast implementation of Random Forests, particularly suited for high dimensional data.
            Ensembles of classification, regression, survival and probability prediction trees are
            supported. Data from genome-wide association studies can be analyzed efficiently. In addition to
            data frames, datasets of class 'gwaa.data' (R package GenABEL) can be directly analyzed.
