Description: A fast implementation of Random Forests, particularly suited for high
         dimensional data. Ensembles of classification, regression, survival and
         probability prediction trees are supported. Data from genome-wide
         association studies can be analyzed efficiently. In addition to data
         frames, datasets of class 'gwaa.data' (R package GenABEL) can be directly
         analyzed.
