Description: Facilitates spatial modeling using integrated nested Laplace approximation via the 
  INLA package (<http://www.r-inla.org>). Additionally, implements a log Gaussian Cox process likelihood for 
  modeling univariate and spatial point processes based on ecological survey data. See Yuan Yuan,
