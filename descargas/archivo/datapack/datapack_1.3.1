Description: Provides a flexible container to transport and
    manipulate complex sets of data. These data may consist of multiple data files and
    associated meta data and ancillary files. Individual data objects have
    associated system level meta data, and data files are linked together using
    the OAI-ORE standard resource map which describes the relationships between the files. 
    The OAI-ORE standard is described at <https://www.openarchives.org/ore>. Data packages 
    can be serialized and transported as structured files that have been created following 
    the BagIt specification. The BagIt specification is described at 
    <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-08>.
