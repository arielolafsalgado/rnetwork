Description: Implementation of a model-based clustering algorithm for
    ranking data (C. Biernacki, J. Jacques (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2012.08.008>). 
    Multivariate rankings as well as partial rankings are taken
    into account. This algorithm is based on an extension of the Insertion
    Sorting Rank (ISR) model for ranking data, which is a meaningful and
    effective model parametrized by a position parameter (the modal ranking,
    quoted by mu) and a dispersion parameter (quoted by pi). The heterogeneity
    of the rank population is modelled by a mixture of ISR, whereas conditional
    independence assumption is considered for multivariate rankings.
