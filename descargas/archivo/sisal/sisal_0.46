Description: Implements the SISAL algorithm by Tikka and HollmÃ©n. It is
        a sequential backward selection algorithm which uses a linear
        model in a cross-validation setting. Starting from the full
        model, one variable at a time is removed based on the
        regression coefficients. From this set of models, a
        parsimonious (sparse) model is found by choosing the model with
        the smallest number of variables among those models where the
        validation error is smaller than a threshold. Also implements
        extensions which explore larger parts of the search space
        and/or use ridge regression instead of ordinary least squares.
