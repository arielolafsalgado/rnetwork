Description: Implements the Expectation Maximisation (EM)/(EM*) algorithm for clustering finite gaussian mixture models for
    both multivariate and univariate datasets. The initialization is done by randomly selecting the samples from the 
    dataset as the mean of the Gaussian(s). This version implements the faster alternative EM* that avoids revisiting 
    data by leveraging the heap structure. The algorithm returns a set of Gaussian parameters-posterior probabilities, mean, co-variance matrices 
    (multivariate data)/standard-deviation (for univariate datasets) and priors.
