        Log-Rank-Tests

Description: It is for all people who have to compute many Log-Rank-Tests and the 'survival' package is not fast enough for their purpose.
  Therefore this small package provides two functions, one for a single Log-Rank-Test and another which calculates many Log-Rank-Tests at a time using threading.
  Both runs very fast because it uses C++ code with 'Rcpp'.
