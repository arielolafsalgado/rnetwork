Title: A Fast Way to Calculate the p-Value of One or Multiple
        Log-Rank-Tests
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Andreas Stelzer
Maintainer: Andreas Stelzer <ga63nep@mytum.de>
Description: It is for all people who have to compute many Log-Rank-Tests and the 'survival' package is not fast enough for their purpose.
  Therefore this small package provides two functions, one for a single Log-Rank-Test and another which calculates many Log-Rank-Tests at a time using threading.
  Both runs very fast because it uses C++ code with 'Rcpp'.
