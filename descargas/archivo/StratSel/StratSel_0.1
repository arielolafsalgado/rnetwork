Description: This package provides functions to estimate a strategic selection estimator. A strategic selection estimator is an agent error model in which the two random components are not assumed to be orthogonal. In addition this package provides generic functions to print and plot objects of the class "StratSel" as well as the necessary functions to create tables for LaTeX. There is also a function to create dyadic data sets.
