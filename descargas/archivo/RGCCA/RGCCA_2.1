Description: Multi-block data analysis concerns the analysis of several sets
    of variables (blocks) observed on the same group of individuals. The main aims
    of the RGCCA package are: (i) to study the relationships between blocks and
    (ii) to identify subsets of variables of each block which are active in their
    relationships with the other blocks.
