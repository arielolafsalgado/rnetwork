Title: 'Rcpp' Bindings to Parser for Tom's Obvious Markup Language
Version: 0.1.5
Date: 2018-10-31
Author: Dirk Eddelbuettel
Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to
 "Tom's Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format (described at
 <https://github.com/toml-lang/toml>) suitable for both human editing as well
 as the common uses of a machine-readable format. This package uses 'Rcpp' to
 connect the 'cpptoml' parser written by Chase Geigle (in modern C++11) to R.
SystemRequirements: A C++11 compiler; g++ (>= 4.8.*) should be fine.
