Maintainer: Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
Description: The configuration format defined by 'TOML' (which expands to
 "Tom's Obvious Markup Language") specifies an excellent format suitable
 for both human editing as well as the obvious uses of a machine-readable
 format. This package uses 'Rcpp' to connect the 'cpptoml' parser written
 by Chase Geigle (in modern C++11) to R.
