Description: The pvsR package facilitates data retrieval from Project
    Vote Smart's rich online data base on US politics via the Project Vote
    Smart application programming interface (PVS API). The functions in this
    package cover most PVS API classes and methods and return the
    requested data in a data frame.

Note: In order to use this package you need your personal Project Vote
        Smart API key. To get an API-key you need to sign up for access
        to PVS' API (see http://votesmart.org/share/api for details).
        Whenever you are using pvsR make sure that your personal PVS
        API key is saved as a character string in the variable pvs.key
        (pvs.key <- "yourkey"). If there is no valid PVS API key saved
        in the variable pvs.key the functions in this package won't
        work. This program is free software; you can redistribute it
