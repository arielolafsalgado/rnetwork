Description: Multilevel data frames of tree rings and climate are modeled into normalized fluctuations of tree growth and aridity.  Modeled fluctuations (model frames) are compared with Mantel correlograms on multiple levels defined by sample design. Package implementation can be understood by running examples in functions ringApply(), modelFrame(), and muleMan().
