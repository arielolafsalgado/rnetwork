Description: Penalized methods are useful for fitting over-parameterized models. This package includes functions for restructuring an ordinal 
 response dataset for fitting continuation ratio models for datasets  where the number of covariates exceeds the sample size or when   
 there is collinearity among the covariates. The glmnet fitting algorithm is used to fit the continuation ratio model after data restructuring.
