Description: Two methods for calculation of the number of required flows for semiconductor sequencing: 1. Using a simulation, the number of flows can be calculated for a concrete list of amplicons. 2. An exact combinatorial model is evaluated to calculate the number of flows for a random ensemble of sequences.
