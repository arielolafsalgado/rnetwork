Description: Analysis of complex plant root system architectures (RSA) using the output files created by Data Analysis of Root Tracings (DART), an open-access software dedicated to the study of plant root architecture and development across time series (Le Bot et al (2010) DART: a software to analyse root system architecture and development from captured images, Plant and Soil, DOI: 10.1007/s11104-009-0005-2), and RSA data encoded with the Root System Markup Language (RSML) (Lobet et al (2015) Root System Markup Language: toward a unified root architecture description language, Plant Physiology, DOI: 10.1104/pp.114.253625). More information can be found in Delory et al (2015) archiDART: an R package for the automated computation of plant root architectural traits, Plant and Soil, DOI: 10.1007/s11104-015-2673-4.
