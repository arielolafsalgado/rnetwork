Description: Analysis of complex plant root system architectures (RSA) using the output files created by Data Analysis of Root Tracings (DART), an open-access software dedicated to the study of plant root architecture and development across time series (Le Bot et al (2010) DART: a software to analyse root system architecture and development from captured images, Plant and Soil, 326, 261--273), and RSA data encoded with the Root System Markup Language (RSML) (Lobet et al (2015) Root System Markup Language: Toward a Unified Root Architecture Description Language, Plant Physiology, 167, 617--627).
