Description: For estimating species abundances that satisfy a given
    functional trait profile. Restoring resilient ecosystems requires a
    flexible framework for selecting assemblages that are based on the functional
    traits of species. However, current trait-based models have been biased toward
    algorithms that can only select species by optimising specific trait values,
    and could not elegantly accommodate the common desire among restoration ecologists
    to produce functionally diverse assemblages. We have solved this problem by
    applying a non-linear optimisation algorithm that optimises Raoâ€™s Q, a closed-form
    functional diversity index that incorporates species abundances, subject to other
    linear constraints. This framework generalises previous models that could only
    optimise the entropy of the community, and can optimise both functional diversity
    and entropy simultaneously.
