Description: Implementation of the classifier described in the paper 'Genome-driven integrated classification of breast cancer validated in over 7,500 samples' (Ali HR et al., Genome Biology 2014). It uses copy number and/or expression form breast cancer data, trains a pamr classifier (Tibshirani et al.) with the features available and predicts the iC10 group.
