Description: iC10 implements the classifier described in the METABRIC paper 'The genomic and transcriptomic architecture of 2,000 breast tumours reveals novel subgroups' (Curtis et al., Nature 2012). It uses copy number and/or expression form breast cancer data, trains a pamr classifier (Tibshirani et al.) with the features available and predicts the iC10 group.
