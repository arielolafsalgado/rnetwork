Description: If there is a need to recognise edges on a raster image or a bitmap or any kind of a matrix, one can find packages
    that does only 90 degrees vectorization. Typically the nature of artefact images is linear and can be vectorized in much more
    efficient way than draw a series of 90 degrees lines. The fasteraster package does recognition of lines using only one pass.
