Description: Package simboot provides estimation of simultaneous
        bootstrap and asymptotic confidence intervals for diversity
        indices, namely the Shannon and the Simpson index. Several
        pre--specified multiple comparison types are available to
        choose. Further user--defined contrast matrices are applicable.
        In addition, simboot estimates adjusted as well as unadjusted
        p--values for two of the three proposed bootstrap methods.
        Further simboot allows for comparing biological diversities of
        two or more groups while simultaneously testing a user-defined
        selection of Hill numbers of orders q, which are considered as
        appropriate and useful indices for measuring diversity.
