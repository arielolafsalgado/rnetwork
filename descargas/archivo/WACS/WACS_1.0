Description: Multivariate weather generator for daily climate variables based 
    on weather-states using a Markov chain for modeling the succession of weather states. 
    Conditionally to the weather states, the multivariate variables are modeled using the family 
    of Complete Skew-Normal distributions. Parameters are estimated on measured series. Data must 
    include the variable 'Rain' and can accept as many other variables as desired.
