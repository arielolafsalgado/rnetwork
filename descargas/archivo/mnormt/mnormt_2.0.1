Description: Functions are provided for computing the density and the
  distribution function of d-dimensional normal and "t" random variables,
  possibly truncated (on one side or two sides, with componentwise choice),
  and for generating random vectors sampled from these distributions,
  except sampling from the truncated "t". Moments of arbitrary order of 
  a truncated normal are computed, and converted to cumulants up to order 4. 
  Probabilities are computed via non-Monte Carlo methods; different routines 
  are used in the case d=1, d=2, d=3, d>3, if d denotes the dimensionality.
