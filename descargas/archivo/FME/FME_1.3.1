Description: Provides functions to help in fitting models to data, to
  perform Monte Carlo, sensitivity and identifiability analysis. It is
  intended to work with models be written as a set of differential
  equations that are solved either by an integration routine from
  package deSolve, or a steady-state solver from package
  rootSolve. However, the methods can also be used with other types of
  functions.
