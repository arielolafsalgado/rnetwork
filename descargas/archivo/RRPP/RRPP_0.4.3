Description: Linear model calculations are made for many random versions of data.  
    Using residual randomization in a permutation procedure, sums of squares are 
    calculated over many permutations to generate empirical probability distributions 
    for evaluating model effects.  This packaged is described by 
    Collyer & Adams (2018) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.13029>.  Additionally, coefficients, statistics, fitted values, and residuals generated over many 
    permutations can be used for various procedures including pairwise tests, prediction, classification, and
    model comparison.  This package should provide most tools one could need for the analysis of
    high-dimensional data, especially in ecology and evolutionary biology, but certainly other fields, as well.
