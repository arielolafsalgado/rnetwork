Description: This package provides Diagnostic tools based on two way
        anova and median polish residual plots for Bicluster output
        obtained from packages; "biclust" by Kaiser et al.(2008),"isa2"
        by Csardi et al. (2010) and "fabia" by Hochreiter et al.
        (2010). Moreover, It provides visualization tools for bicluster
        output and corresponding non bicluster rows or columns
        outcomes.  It has also extended the idea of Kaiser et al.(2008)
        which is, extracting bicluster output in a text format, by
        adding by adding two bicluster methods from fabia and isa2 r
        packages.
