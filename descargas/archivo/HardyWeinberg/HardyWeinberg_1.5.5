Description: Contains tools for exploring Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for
  diallelic genetic marker data. All classical tests (chi-square, exact,
  likelihood-ratio and permutation tests) for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
  are included in the package, as well as functions for power computation and
  for the simulation of marker data under equilibrium and disequilibrium.
  Functions for testing equilibrium in the presence of missing data by
  using multiple imputation are also provided. Implements several graphics
  for exploring the equilibrium status of a large set of diallelic markers: 
  ternary plots with acceptance regions, log-ratio plots and Q-Q plots.
