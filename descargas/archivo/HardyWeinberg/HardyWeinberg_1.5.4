Description: Package HardyWeinberg is a package for exploring
 bi-allelic marker data. It focuses on the graphical
 representation of the results of tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
 in a ternary plot. Routines for several tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
 are included in the package. Procedures for handling missing genotype
 data are included.
