Description: Create and format tables and APA statistics for
    scientific publication. This includes making a 'Table 1'
    to summarize demographics across groups, correlation tables
    with significance indicated by stars, and extracting formatted
    statistical summarizes from simple tests for in-text notation.
    The package also includes functions for Winsorizing data based
    on a Z-statistic cutoff.
