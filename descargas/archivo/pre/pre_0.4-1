Description: Derives prediction rule ensembles (PREs). Largely follows the
    procedure for deriving PREs as described in Friedman & Popescu (2008; 
    <DOI:10.1214/07-AOAS148>), with several adjustments and improvements. The 
    main function pre() derives prediction rule ensembles consisting of rules 
    and/or linear terms for binary, count and continuous responses. Function 
    gpe() derives generalized prediction ensembles, consisting of rules, hinge
    and linear functions of the predictor variables.
