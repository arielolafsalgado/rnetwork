Description: Derives prediction rule ensembles (PREs). Largely follows the
    procedure for deriving PREs as described in Friedman & Popescu (2008; 
    <DOI:10.1214/07-AOAS148>), with adjustments and improvements. The 
    main function pre() derives prediction rule ensembles consisting of 
    rules and/or linear terms for continuous, binary, count, multinomial, 
    and multivariate continuous responses. Function gpe() derives 
    generalized prediction ensembles, consisting of rules, hinge and linear 
    functions of the predictor variables.
