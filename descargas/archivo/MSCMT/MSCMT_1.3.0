Description: Multivariate Synthetic Control Method Using Time Series. 
    Three generalizations of the synthetic control method (which has already an 
    implementation in package 'Synth') are implemented: first, 'MSCMT' allows 
    for using multiple outcome variables, second, time series can be supplied as 
    economic predictors, and third, a well-defined cross-validation approach can be used.
    Much effort has been taken to make the implementation as stable as possible 
    (including edge cases) without losing computational efficiency.
