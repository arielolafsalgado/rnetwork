Description: Multivariate Synthetic Control Method Using Time Series. 
    Two generalizations of the synthetic control method (which has already an 
    implementation in package 'Synth') are implemented: first, 'MSCMT' allows 
    for using multiple outcome variables, second, time series can be supplied as 
    economic predictors. 
    Much effort has been taken to make the implementation as stable as possible 
    (including edge cases) without losing computational efficiency.
