Title: Citations for 'Knitr' Markdown Files
Authors@R: person("Carl", "Boettiger", role=c("aut", "cre"),
    email="cboettig@gmail.com")
Version: 1.0.8
Description: Provides the ability to create dynamic citations
    in which the bibliographic information is pulled from the web rather
    than having to be entered into a local database such as 'bibtex' ahead of
    time. The package is primarily aimed at authoring in the R 'markdown'
    format, and can provide outputs for web-based authoring such as linked
    text for inline citations.  Cite using a 'DOI', URL, or
    'bibtex' file key.  See the package URL for details.
