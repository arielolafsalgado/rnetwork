Description: knitcitations provides the ability to create dynamic citations
    in which the bibliographic information is pulled from the web rather
    than having to be entered into a local database such as bibtex ahead of
    time. Knitcitations is primarily aimed at authoring in the R markdown
    format, and can provide outputs for web-based authoring such as linked
    text and tooltips over inline citations.  Cite using a DOI, URL, or
    bibtex file key.  See the package URL for details.
