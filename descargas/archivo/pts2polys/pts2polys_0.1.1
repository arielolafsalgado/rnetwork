Description: Various applications in invasive species biology,
    conservation biology, epidemiology and elsewhere involve 
    sampling of sets of 2D points from a posterior distribution.
    The number of such point sets may be large, say 1000 or 10000. 
    This package facilitates visualisation of such output by 
    constructing seven nested polygons representing the location and 
    variability of the point sets. This can be used, for example, to 
    visualise the range boundary of a species, and uncertainty in 
    the location of that boundary.
