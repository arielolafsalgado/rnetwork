Description: Some functions of 'ade4' and 'stats' are combined in order to obtain a partition of the rows of a data table, with columns representing variables of scales: quantitative, qualitative or frequency. 
  First, a principal axes method is performed and then, a combination of Ward agglomerative hierarchical classification and K-means is performed, using some of the first coordinates obtained from the previous principal axes method. 
  The function 'kmeansW', a modification of 'kmeans', programmed in C++, is included, in order to permit to have different weights of the elements to be clustered. Some complementary functions and datasets are included.
