Description: Based on the aggregated shares retained by individual firms or actors within a market or space, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) measures the level of concentration in the market or space. It is often used as a measure of competition, where 0 equals perfect competition amongst firms or actors and 10,000 equals perfect monopoly. This package allows for intuitive and straightforward computation of the HHI, requiring placement of objects directly into the function, including the data frame first, followed by the name of the vector (or variable) corresponding with the market shares in quotation marks. The package also includes a plot function for quick visual display of HHI time series across any measure of time (year, quarter, month, etc.) Suggested citation of the HHI: Rhoades, Stephen A. (1993, "The herfindahl-hirschman index." Federal Reserve Bulletin 79: 188).
