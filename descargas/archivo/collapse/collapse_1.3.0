Description: A C/C++ based package for advanced data transformation and 
    statistical computing in R that is extremely fast, flexible and 
    parsimonious to code with and programmer friendly. 
    It is well integrated with 'dplyr', 'plm' and 'data.table'.
    --- Key Features: ---
    (1) Advanced statistical programming: A full set of fast statistical functions 
        supporting grouped and weighted computations on vectors, matrices and 
        data frames. Fast and programmable grouping, ordering, unique values / rows, 
        factor generation and interactions. Fast and flexible functions for data 
        manipulation and data object conversions.
    (2) Advanced aggregation: Fast and easy multi-data-type, multi-function, 
        weighted, parallelized and fully customized data aggregation.
    (3) Advanced transformations: Fast (grouped) replacing and sweeping out of 
        statistics, and (grouped, weighted) scaling / standardizing, between 
        (averaging) and (quasi-)within (centering / demeaning) transformations, 
        higher-dimensional centering (i.e. multiple fixed effects transformations), 
        linear prediction and partialling-out.
    (4) Advanced time-computations: Fast (sequences of) lags / leads, and 
        (lagged / leaded, iterated, quasi-, log-) differences and growth 
        rates on (unordered) time series and panel data. Multivariate auto-, 
        partial- and cross-correlation functions for panel data. 
        Panel data to (ts-)array conversions.
    (5) List processing: (Recursive) list search / identification, extraction / 
        subsetting, data-apply, and generalized row-binding / unlisting in 2D.
    (6) Advanced data exploration: Fast (grouped, weighted, panel-decomposed) 
        summary statistics for complex multilevel / panel data.
