Description: Efficient procedures for constructing uniform design of experiments under various space-filling criteria. It is based on a stochastic and adaptive threshold accepting algorithm with flexible initialization, adaptive threshold, and stochastic evolution. The package may also construct the augmented uniform designs in a sequential manner. View details at: Zhang, A. and Li, H. (2017). UniDOE: An R package for constructing uniform design of experiments via stochastic and adaptive threshold accepting algorithm.
