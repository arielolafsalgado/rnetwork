Description: This package automates many of the tasks associated with
    quantitative discourse analysis of transcripts containing discourse
    including frequency counts of sentence types, words, sentences, turns of
    talk, syllables and other assorted analysis tasks.  The package
    provides parsing tools for preparing transcript data.  Many functions
    enable the user to aggregate data by any number of grouping variables,
    providing analysis and seamless integration with other R packages that
    undertake higher level analysis and visualization of text.  This affords
    the user a more efficient and targeted analysis.  qdap is designed for
    transcript analysis, however, many functions are applicable to other areas
    of Text Mining/Natural Language Processing.
