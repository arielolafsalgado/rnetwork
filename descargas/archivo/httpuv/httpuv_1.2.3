Description: httpuv provides low-level socket and protocol support for handling
  HTTP and WebSocket requests directly from within R. It is primarily intended
  as a building block for other packages, rather than making it particularly
  easy to create complete web applications using httpuv alone. httpuv is built
  on top of the libuv and http-parser C libraries, both of which were developed
  by Joyent, Inc. (See LICENSE file for libuv and http-parser license
  information.)
