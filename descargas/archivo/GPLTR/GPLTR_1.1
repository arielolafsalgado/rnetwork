Description: Combining a generalized linear model with an additional tree part 
          on the same scale. A four-step procedure is proposed to fit the model and test 
          the joint effect of the selected tree part while adjusting on confounding factors. 
          We also proposed an ensemble procedure based on the bagging to improve prediction 
          accuracy and computed several scores of importance for variable selection.
