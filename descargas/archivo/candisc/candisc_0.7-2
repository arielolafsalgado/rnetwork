Description: Functions for computing and visualizing 
	generalized canonical discriminant analyses and canonical correlation analysis
	for a multivariate linear model.
	Traditional canonical discriminant analysis is restricted to a one-way 'MANOVA'
	design and is equivalent to canonical correlation analysis between a set of quantitative
	response variables and a set of dummy variables coded from the factor variable.
	The 'candisc' package generalizes this to higher-way 'MANOVA' designs
	for all factors in a multivariate linear model,
	computing canonical scores and vectors for each term. The graphic functions provide low-rank (1D, 2D, 3D) 
	visualizations of terms in an 'mlm' via the 'plot.candisc' and 'heplot.candisc' methods. Related plots are
	now provided for canonical correlation analysis when all predictors are quantitative.
