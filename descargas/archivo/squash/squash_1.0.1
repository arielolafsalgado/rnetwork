Title: Color-based plots for multivariate visualization
Author: Aron Eklund
Maintainer: Aron Eklund <eklund+squash@cbs.dtu.dk>
Depends: grDevices
Description: This package provides functions for color-based
        visualization of multivariate data, i.e. colorgrams or
        heatmaps.  Lower-level functions are provided to map numeric
        values to colors, display a matrix as an array of colors, and
        draw color keys.  Higher-level plotting functions are provided
        to generate a bivariate histogram, a dendrogram aligned with a
        color-coded matrix, a triangular distance matrix, and more.
