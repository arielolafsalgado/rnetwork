Description: Implements the algorithm described in 
    Barron, M., Zhang, S. and Li, J. "A sparse differential
    clustering algorithm for tracing cell type changes via single-cell
    RNA-sequencing data"  (Unpublished). This algorithm clusters samples from two different
    populations, links the clusters across the conditions and identifies 
    marker genes for these changes. The package was designed for scRNA-Seq
    data but is also applicable to many other data types, just replace cells
    with samples and genes with variables. The package also contains functions
    for estimating the parameters for SparseDC as outlined in the paper.
