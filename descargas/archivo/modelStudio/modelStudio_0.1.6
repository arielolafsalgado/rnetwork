Description: Automate explanation of machine learning predictive models.
  This package generates advanced interactive and animated model explanations in the form
  of serverless HTML site. It combines 'R' with 'D3.js' to produce plots and descriptions
  for local and global explanations. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts,
  so it also supports EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on top of that. 'modelStudio' is
  a fast and condensed way to get all the answers without much effort. 
  Break down your model and look into its ingredients with only a few lines of code.
