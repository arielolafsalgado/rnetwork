Description: Automate the explanatory analysis of machine learning predictive models.
    Generate advanced interactive and animated model explanations in the form of
    a serverless HTML site with only one line of code. This tool is model agnostic,
    therefore compatible with most of the black box predictive models and frameworks.
    The main function computes various (instance and dataset level) model explanations
    and produces an interactive, customizable dashboard made with 'D3.js'. It consists
    of multiple panels for plots with their short descriptions. Easily save and share 
    the dashboard with others. Tools for model exploration unite with tools for EDA 
    (Exploratory Data Analysis) to give a broad overview of the model behavior.
