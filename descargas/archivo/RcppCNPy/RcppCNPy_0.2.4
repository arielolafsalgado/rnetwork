Description: The cnpy library written by Carl Rogers provides read and write

 Vectors and matrices of numeric types can be read or written to and from
 files as well as compressed files. Support for integer files is available if
 the package has been built with -std=c++11 which is the default starting
 with release 0.2.3 following the release of R 3.1.0.
