Description: Port of the new Matplotlib default color map ('viridis') to R.
    This color map is designed in such a way that it will analytically be
    perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when
    converted to black-and-white. It is also designed to be perceived by
    readers with the most common form of color blindness.
