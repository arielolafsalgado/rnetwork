Authors@R: c(person(given="Aiora", family="Zabala", email="aiora.zabala@gmail.com", role=c("aut", "cre")))
Description: Analyses Q methodology data to identify the distinct perspectives existing within a group. This methodology is used across social, health and environmental sciences to understand diversity of attitudes, discourses, or decision-making styles. The function qmethod() runs the full analysis and each step can be run separately using the corresponding functions: qflag() for automatic flagging of Q-sorts (manual flagging is optional), qzscores() for scores for statements, qda() for distinguishing and consensus statements, and qfcharact() for general characteristics of the factors. It includes a function to import data from PQMethod software, to export plain text data for interpretation in two flavours, and to plot Q method results. The package uses principal components and it offers the following choices: manual or automatic flagging, a number of mathematical methods for rotation, and a number of correlation coefficients for the initial correlation matrix.
