Description: Contains procedures for depth-based supervised learning, which are entirely nonparametric, in particular the DDalpha-procedure. The training data sample is transformed by a statistical depth function to a compact low-dimensional space, where the final classification is done. It also offers an extension to functional data and routines for calculating certain notions of statistical depth functions. 50 multivariate and 5 functional classification problems are included.
