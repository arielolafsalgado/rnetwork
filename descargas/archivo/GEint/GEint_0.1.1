Description: Compute the bias in misspecified linear gene-environment interaction models. The most 
	generalized function for this objective is GE_bias().  However GE_bias() requires specification of many
	higher order moments of covariates in the model.  If users are unsure about how to calculate/estimate
	these higher order moments, it may be easier to use GE_bias_normal_squaredmis().  This function places
	many more assumptions on the covariates (most notably that they are all jointly generated from a multivariate
	normal distribution) and is thus able to automatically calculate many of the higher order moments automatically,
	necessitating only that the user specify some covariances.  There are also functions to solve for the bias 
	through simulation and non-linear equation solvers, these can be used to check your work.
