Description: CliFlo is a web portal to the New Zealand National Climate
    Database and provides public access (via subscription) to around 6,500
    various climate stations (see <http://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/> for more 
    information). Collating and manipulating data from CliFlo
    (hence clifro) and importing into R for further analysis, exploration and
    visualisation is now straightforward and coherent. The user is required to
    have an internet connection, and a current CliFlo subscription (free) if
    data from stations, other than the public Reefton electronic weather
    station, is sought.
