Description: CliFlo is a web portal to the New Zealand National Climate
    Database and provides public access (via subscription) to around 6,500
    various climate stations. Collating and manipulating data from CliFlo
    (hence clifro) and importing into R for further analysis, exploration and
    visualisation is now straightforward and coherent. The user is required to
    have an internet connection, and a current CliFlo subscription (free) if
    data from stations, other than the public Reefton electronic weather
    station, is sought.
