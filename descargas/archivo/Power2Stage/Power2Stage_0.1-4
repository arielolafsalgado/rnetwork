Description: Contains functions to calculate power and sample size distribution
             of 2-stage BE studies with a 2x2 crossover design according to 
             Potvin et.al. / Montague et. al. modified to include a futility Nmax 
             and modified to do the sample size estimation step with PE and mse  
             of stage 1 as well as the power calculation steps according to
             Karalis & Macheras.
             The third function calculates power and sample size distribution
             of 2-stage BE studies with a futility criterion for the point
             estimator of T/R from stage 1.
             The fourth function calculates power of non-adaptive group 
             sequential (2-stage) BE studies.
             The fifth function calculates power and sample size distribution
             of 2-stage BE studies in 2 parallel groups.
