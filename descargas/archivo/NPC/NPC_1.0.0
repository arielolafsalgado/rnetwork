Description: An implementation of nonparametric combination of hypothesis tests.
    This package performs nonparametric combination (Pesarin and Salmaso 2010),
    a permutation-based procedure for jointly testing multiple hypotheses. The
    tests are conducted under the global "sharp" null hypothesis of no effects,
    and the component tests are combined on the metric of their p-values. A
    key feature of nonparametric combination is that it accounts for the
    dependence among tests under the null hypothesis. In addition to the
    "NPC" function, which performs nonparametric combination itself, the
    package also contains a number of helper functions, many of which calculate
    a test statistic given an input of data.
