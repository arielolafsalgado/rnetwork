Description: Functions to automate downloading geospatial data available from
    several federated data sources (mainly sources maintained by the US Federal
    government). Currently, the package allows for retrieval of five datasets:
    The National Elevation Dataset digital elevation models (1 and 1/3 arc-second;
    USGS); The National Hydrography Dataset (USGS); The Soil Survey Geographic
    (SSURGO) database from the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS), which is
    led by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) under the USDA; the
    Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), coordinated by National Climatic
    Data Center at NOAA; and the International Tree Ring Data Bank. Additional
    data sources are in the works, including global DEM resources (ETOPO1, ETOPO5,
    ETOPO30, SRTM), global soils (HWSD), MODIS satellite data products, the National
    Atlas (US), Natural Earth, PRISM, and WorldClim.
