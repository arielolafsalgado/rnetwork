Description: This package implements cumulative link (mixed) models also known
    as ordered regression models, proportional odds models, proportional
    hazards models for grouped survival times and ordered logit/probit/...
    models. Estimation is via maximum likelihood and mixed models are fitted
    with the Laplace approximation and adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature.
    Multiple random effect terms are allowed and they may be nested, crossed or
    partially nested/crossed. Restrictions of symmetry and equidistance can be
    imposed on the thresholds (cut-points). Standard model methods are
    available (summary, anova, drop-methods, step, confint, predict etc.) in
    addition to profile methods and slice methods for visualizing the
    likelihood function and checking convergence.
