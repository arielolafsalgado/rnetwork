Title: Design and Monitoring of Survival Trials Accounting for Complex
        Situations
Description: Calculates various functions needed for design and monitoring survival trials
    accounting for complex situations such as delayed treatment effect, treatment crossover, non-uniform accrual,
    and different censoring distributions between groups. The event time distribution is assumed to be
    piecewise exponential (PWE) distribution and the entry time is assumed to be piecewise uniform distribution.
    As compared with Version 1.1.0, this version includes the calculation of the restricted mean survival time and weighted log-rank statistics.
