Description: Generates risk estimates and comorbidity flags from ICD-9-CM 
  codes available in administrative medical datasets. The package supports 
  the Charlson Comorbidity Index, the Elixhauser Comorbidity
  classification, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, and the Risk Stratification 
  Index.  Methods are table-based, fast, and use the plyr package, so
  parallelization is possible for large jobs. Also includes a sample of 
  real ICD-9 data for 100 patients from a publicly available dataset.
