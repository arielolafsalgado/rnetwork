Description: Set of tools to fit a linear multiple or semi-parametric regression
    models and non-informative right-censoring may be considered. Under this setup, the localization parameter of the response variable distribution is modeled by using linear multiple regression
    or semi-parametric functions, whose non-parametric components may be approximated
    by natural cubic spline or P-splines. The supported distribution for the model error is a generalized log-gamma distribution which includes
    the generalized extreme value distribution as an important special case.
