Description: Allows the calculation of both genetic diversity partition 
             statistics,genetic differentiation statistics and locus
             informativeness for ancestry assignment. It also provides users 
             with various option to calculate bootstrapped 95% confidence 
             intervals both across loci, for pairwise population comparisons 
             and to plot these results interactively. V1.2 and up provides 
             parallel computing capabilities and pairwise results without 
             bootstrapping. Weir and Cockerham's 1984 F-statistics are now 
             also calculated. Various plotting features are also provided. 
             Chi-square tests of genetic heterogeneity are also provided. 
             Functionality for the calculation of various diversity 
             parameters is also possible for RAD-seq derived SNP data sets 
             containing thousands of marker loci. A shiny application for 
             the development of microsatellite multiplexes is also available
