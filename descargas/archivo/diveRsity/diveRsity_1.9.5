Description: diveRsity is a package which allows the calculation of both genetic
    diversity partition statistics, genetic differentiation statistics and locus
    informativeness for ancestry assignment. It also provides users with various
    option to calculate bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals both across loci,
    for pairwise population comparisons and to plot these results interactively.
    V1.2 and up provides parallel computing capabilities and pairwise results
    without bootstrapping. Weir and Cockerham's 1984 F-statistics are now also
    calculated. Various plotting features are also provided. Chi-square tests of
    genetic heterogeneity are also provided. Functionality for the calculation
    of various diversity parameters is also possible for RAD-seq derived SNP
    data sets containing thousands of marker loci. A shiny application for the
    development of microsatellite multiplexes is also available
