Title: Tool for Ensemble Feature Selection
Description: Provides a function to check the
  importance of a feature based on a dependent classification
  variable. An ensemble of correlation and importance measure
  tests are used to determine the normed importance value of
  all features. Combining these methods in one function
  (building the sum of the importance values) leads to a better
  tool for selecting most important features. This selection
  can also be viewed in a barplot using the barplot_fs() function
  and proved using an also provided function for a logistic
  regression model, namely logreg_test().
