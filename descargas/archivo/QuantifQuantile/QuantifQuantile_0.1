Description: Estimation of conditional quantiles using optimal quantization.
    Construction of an optimal grid of N quantizers, estimation of conditional
    quantiles and data driven selection of the size N of the grid. Graphical
    illustrations for the selection of N and of resulting estimated curves or
    surfaces when the dimension of the covariable is one or two.
