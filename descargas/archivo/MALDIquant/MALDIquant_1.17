Description: A complete analysis pipeline for matrix-assisted laser
        desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and other
        two-dimensional mass spectrometry data. In addition to commonly
        used plotting and processing methods it includes distinctive
        features, namely baseline subtraction methods such as
        morphological filters (TopHat) or the statistics-sensitive
        non-linear iterative peak-clipping algorithm (SNIP), peak
        alignment using warping functions, handling of replicated
        measurements as well as allowing spectra with different
        resolutions.
