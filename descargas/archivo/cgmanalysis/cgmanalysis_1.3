Title: Clean and Analyze Continuous Glucose Monitor Data
Version: 1.3
Authors@R: person("Tim", "Vigers", email = "tim.b.vigers@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This code provides several different functions for cleaning and analyzing continuous glucose monitor data. Currently it works with 'Dexcom' (<https://www.dexcom.com>) or 'iPro 2' (<http://professional.medtronicdiabetes.com/ipro2-professional-cgm>) data. The makecsv() function can convert files to CSV if they have been saved as 'Excel' documents. The cleaniprodata() and cleandexcomdata() functions take a directory of CGM data files and clean them for analysis. Finally, cgmvariables() iterates through a directory of cleaned CGM data files and produces a single spreadsheet with data for each file. This spreadsheet is compatible with REDCap data upload ("--1" is added to each subject ID automatically for double data entry).
