Description: This package includes several methods to create virtual species
    distribution map. Those maps can be used for species distribution modelling
    (SDM) study. SDM use environmental data for sites of occurrence of a
    species to predict all the sites where the environmental conditions are
    suitable for the species to persist, and may be expected to occur.
