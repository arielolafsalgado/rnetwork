        Sciences", Cambridge University Press. It grew to include functions 
	for performing set-theoretic multi-method research, QCA for clustered 
	data, theory evaluation, and Enhanced Standard Analysis. Additionally 
	it includes data to replicate the examples in the book and in the online 
	appendix.
