Description: An implementation of the RuleFit algorithm as described in Friedman & Popescu 
  (2008) <doi:10.1214/07-AOAS148>. eXtreme Gradient Boosting ('XGBoost') is used 
  to build rules, and 'glmnet' is used to fit a sparse linear model on the raw and rule features. The result
  is a model that learns similarly to a tree ensemble, while often offering improved interpretability
  and achieving improved scoring runtime in live applications. Several algorithms for
  reducing rule complexity are provided, most notably hyperrectangle de-overlapping. All algorithms scale to 
  several million rows and support sparse representations to handle tens of thousands of dimensions.
