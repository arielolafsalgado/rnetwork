Description: Uses Stochastic Search Variable Selection to select important
    covariates in the three hazard functions of a semi-competing risks model. This
    function performs the Gibbs sampler for variable selection and a Metropolis-Hastings-Green sampler for the number of split points and parameters for the
    three baseline hazard function. This function returns the posterior sample of
    all quantities sampled in the Gibbs sampler after a burn-in period to a desired
    file location.
