Title: General Purpose Interface to Elasticsearch
Description: Connect to Elasticsearch, a NoSQL database built on the Java Virtual Machine. 
    Interacts with the Elasticsearch HTTP API (http://elasticsearch.org), including 
    functions for setting connection details to Elasticsearch instances, loading bulk 
    data, searching for documents with both HTTP query variables and JSON based body

    indices, documents, nodes, clusters, an interface to the cat API, and more.
