Description: Facilities for constructing variance dispersion graphs, fraction-of-design-space plots 
    and similar graphics for exploring the properties of experimental designs. The design region is 
    explored via random sampling, which allows for more flexibility than traditional variance 
    dispersion graphs. A formula interface is leveraged to provide access to complex model 
    formulae. Graphics can be constructed simultaneously for multiple experimental designs and/or 
    multiple model formulae. Instead of using pointwise optimization to find the minimum and 
    maximum scaled prediction variance curves, which can be inaccurate and time consuming, this 
    package uses quantile regression as an alternative.
