Description: YuGene is a simple method for comparison of gene
        expression generated across different experiments, and on
        different platforms; that does not require global
        renormalization, and is not restricted to comparison of
        identical probes. YuGene works on a range of microarray dataset
        distributions, such as between manufacturers. The resulting
        output allows direct comparisons of gene expression between
        experiments and experimental platforms.
