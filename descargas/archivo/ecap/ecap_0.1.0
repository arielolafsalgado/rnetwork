Description: Implements the Excess Certainty Adjusted Probability adjustment procedure as described in the paper "Irrational Exuberance: Correcting Bias in Probability Estimates" by Gareth James, Peter Radchenko, and Bradley Rava (Journal of the American Statistical Association, 2020;  <arXiv:1910.13570>). The package includes a function that preforms the ECAP adjustment and a function that estimates the parameters needed for implementing ECAP. For testing and reproducibility, the ESPN and FiveThirtyEight data used in the paper are also included.
