Description: SIGORA is a Pathway Analysis package. Pathway Analysis is
        the process of statistically linking observations on the
        molecular level to biological processes or pathways on the
        systems (cell, tissue, organ, organism) level. Traditional
        pathway analysis methods regard pathways as collections of
        single genes and treat all genes in a pathway as equally
        informative. This can lead to identification of
        spurious/misleading pathways as statistically significant,
        since many components are shared amongst pathways. SIGORA seeks
        to avoid this pitfall by focusing on genes or gene-pairs that
        are (as a combination) specific to a single pathway. In relying
        on such pathway gene-pair signatures (Pathway-GPSs), SIGORA
        inherently uses the status of other genes in the experimental
        context to identify the most relevant pathways. The current
        version allows for pathway analysis of human and mouse data
        sets and contains pre-computed Pathway-GPS data for pathways in
        the KEGG, PID_BIOCARTA, PID_NCI, INOH and REACTOME pathway
        repositories. For more information, please see our manuscript
        submitted to Bioinformatics, 2012.
