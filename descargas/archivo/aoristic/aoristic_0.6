Description: 'Aoristic' is one of the past tenses in Greek and represents an
    uncertain occurrence time.  Aoristic analysis suggested by Ratcliffe (2002)
    is a method to analyze events that do not have exact times of occurrence
    but have starting times and ending times.  For example, a property crime
    database (e.g., burglary) typically has a starting time and ending time of
    the crime that could have occurred.  Aoristic analysis allocates the
    probability of a crime incident occurring at every hour over a 24-hour
    period. The probability is aggregated over a study area to create an
    aoristic graph.
    Using crime incident data with lat/lon, DateTimeFrom, and
    DateTimeTo, functions in this package create a total of three (3) kml
    files and corresponding aoristic graphs: 1) density and contour; 2) grid
    count; and 3) shapefile boundary. (see also:
