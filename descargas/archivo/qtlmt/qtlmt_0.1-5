Description: Provides tools for joint analysis of multiple traits in a backcross (BC) or recombinant inbred lines (RIL) population. It can be used to select an optimal subset of traits for multiple-trait mapping, analyze multiple traits via the SURE model, which can associate different QTL with different traits, and perform multiple-trait composite multiple-interval mapping.
