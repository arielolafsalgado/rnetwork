Description: This package is a reboot of the AnalysisSuite
    (https://github.com/jefferis/AnalysisSuite) bundle of R code that I have
    been using for a number of years to analyse and visualise 3D biological
    image data, especially traced neurons. AnalysisSuite is most easily
    installed using the nat.as package presently available at
    https://github.com/jefferis/nat.as. The nat package is considerably cleaner
    but currently provides only a subset of the full functionality of nat.as /
    AnalysisSuite. nat can read and write 3D images in NRRD and Amira formats
    and read surfaces in Amira's hxsurf format. Traced neurons can be imported
    from and written to SWC and Amira LineSet and SkeletonGraph formats. These
    data can then be visualised in 3D via rgl, manipulated including applying
    calculated registrations, e.g. using the CMTK registration suite, and
    analysed. The package also has a simple representation for neurons that
    have been subjected to a 3D skeletonisation but not formally traced; this
    allows morphological comparison between neurons including searches and
    clustering.
Depends: R (>= 2.15.1), rgl
