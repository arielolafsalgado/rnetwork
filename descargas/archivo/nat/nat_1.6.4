Description: NeuroAnatomy Toolbox (nat) is a reboot of the AnalysisSuite
    (see https://github.com/jefferis/nat.as) bundle of R code that we have
    been using for a number of years to analyse and visualise 3D biological
    image data, especially traced neurons. The nat package is considerably 
    cleaner, properly documented and provides all of the core functionality of
    nat.as / AnalysisSuite. nat can read and write 3D images in NRRD and Amira
    formats and read surfaces in Amira's hxsurf format. Traced neurons can be
    imported from and written to SWC and Amira LineSet and SkeletonGraph
    formats. These data can then be visualised in 3D via rgl, manipulated 
    including applying calculated registrations, e.g. using the CMTK 
    registration suite, and analysed. The package also has a simple 
    representation for neurons that have been subjected to a 3D skeletonisation
    but not formally traced; this allows morphological comparison between 
    neurons including searches and clustering (via the nat.nblast extension 
    package).
