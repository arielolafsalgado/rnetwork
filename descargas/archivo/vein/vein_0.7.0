Description: Elaboration of vehicular emissions inventories,
    consisting in four stages, pre-processing activity data, preparing 
    emissions factors, estimating the emissions and post-processing of emissions 
    in maps and databases. More details in Ibarra-Espinosa et al (2018) <doi:10.5194/gmd-11-2209-2018>.
