Description: Provides functions to aid the identification of probable/possible
    duplicates in Plant Genetic Resources (PGR) collections using
    'passport databases' comprising of information records of each constituent
    sample. These include methods for cleaning the data, creation of a
    searchable Key Word in Context (KWIC) index of keywords associated with
    sample records and the identification of nearly identical records with
    similar information by fuzzy, phonetic and semantic matching of keywords.
Depends: R (>= 3.0.2)
