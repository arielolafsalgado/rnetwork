Description: Functions to prepare rankings data and fit the Plackett-Luce model
    jointly attributed to Plackett (1975) <doi:10.2307/2346567> and Luce 
    (1959, ISBN:0486441369). The standard Plackett-Luce model is generalized 
    to accommodate ties of any order in the ranking. Partial rankings, in which 
    only a subset of items are ranked in each ranking, are also accommodated in
    the implementation. Disconnected/weakly connected networks implied by the 
    rankings are handled by adding pseudo-rankings with a hypothetical item. 
    Methods are provided to estimate standard errors or quasi-standard errors 
    for inference as well as to fit Plackett-Luce trees. See the package website
    or vignette for full details.
