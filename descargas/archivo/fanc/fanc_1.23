Description: An R package "fanc" computes the penalized maximum
        likelihood estimates of factor loadings and unique variances
        for various tuning parameters. The pathwise coordinate descent
        along with EM algorithm is used.  This package also includes a
        new graphical tool which outputs path diagram, goodness-of-fit
        indices and model selection criteria for each regularization
        parameter. The user can change the regularization parameter by
        manipulating scrollbars, which is helpful to find a suitable
        value of regularization parameter.
