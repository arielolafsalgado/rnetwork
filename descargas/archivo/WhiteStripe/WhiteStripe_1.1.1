Title: White Matter Normalization for Magnetic Resonance Images using
        Whitestripe
Version: 1.1.1

Description: Shinohara et. al introduced Whitestripe, an 
        intensity-based normalization of T1 and T2 images, where normal
        appearing white matter performs well, but requires segmentation.
        This method performs white matter mean and standard deviation
        estimates on data that has been rigidly-registered to the MNI
        template and uses histogram-based methods.
