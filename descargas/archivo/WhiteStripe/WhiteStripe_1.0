Description: Whitestripe normalization from Shinohara et. al does For
    intensity-based normalization of T1 and T2 images, where normal appearing
    white matter performs well, but requires segmentation.  This method
    performs white matter mean and standard deviation estimates on data that
    has been rigidly-registered to the MNI template and uses histogram-based
    methods.
