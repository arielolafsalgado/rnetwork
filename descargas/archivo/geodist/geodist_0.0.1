Description: Dependency-free, ultra fast calculation of geodesic distances.
    Includes the reference nanometre-accuracy geodesic distances of Karney
    (2013) <doi:10.1007/s00190-012-0578-z>, as used by the 'sf' package, as well
    as Haversine and Vincenty distances. Default distance measure is the "Mapbox
    cheap ruler" which is generally more accurate than Haversine or Vincenty for
    distances out to a few hundred kilometres, and is considerably faster. The
    main function accepts one or two inputs in almost any generic rectangular
    form, and returns either matrices of pairwise distances, or vectors of
    sequential distances.
