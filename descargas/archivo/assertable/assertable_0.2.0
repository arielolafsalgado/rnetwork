Title: Verbose Assertions for Tabular Data (Data.frames and
        Data.tables)
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Grant Nguyen
Maintainer: Grant Nguyen <gngu@uw.edu>
Description: Simple, flexible, assertions on data.frame or data.table objects with verbose output for vetting. While other assertion packages apply towards more general use-cases, assertable is tailored towards tabular data. It includes functions to check variable names and values, whether the dataset contains all combinations of a given set of unique identifiers, and whether it is a certain length. In addition, assertable includes utility functions to check the existence of target files and to efficiently import multiple tabular data files into one data.table.
