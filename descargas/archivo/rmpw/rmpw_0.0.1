Title: Causal Mediation Analysis Using Weighting Approach
Author: Xu Qin, Guanglei Hong
Maintainer: Xu Qin <xuqin@uchicago.edu>
Description: We implement causal mediation analysis using the methods proposed by Hong (2010) and Hong, Deutsch & Hill (2015) <doi:10.3102/1076998615583902>. It allows the estimation and hypothesis testing of causal mediation effects through ratio of mediator probability weights (RMPW). This strategy conveniently relaxes the assumption of no treatment-by-mediator interaction while greatly simplifying the outcome model specification without invoking strong distributional assumptions.
