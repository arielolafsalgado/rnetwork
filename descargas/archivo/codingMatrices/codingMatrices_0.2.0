Title: Alternative Factor Coding Matrices for Linear Model Formulae
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Bill Venables
Maintainer: Bill Venables <Bill.Venables@gmail.com>
Description: A collection of coding functions as alternatives to the standard
    functions in the stats package, which have names starting with 'contr.'.  Their
    main advantage is that they provide a consistent method for defining marginal
    effects in multi-way factorial models.  In a simple one-way ANOVA model the
    intercept term is always the simple average of the class means.
