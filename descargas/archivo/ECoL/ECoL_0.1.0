Title: Complexity Measures for Classification Problems
Description: Provides measures to characterize the complexity of classification 
    problems based on the ambiguity and the separation between the classes and 
    the data sparsity and dimensionality of the datasets. This package provides 
    bug fixes, generalizations and implementations of many state of the art 
    measures. The measures are described in the paper: Tin Ho and Mitra Basu 
    (2002) <doi:10.1109/34.990132>.
