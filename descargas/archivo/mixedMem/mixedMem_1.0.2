Description: Fits mixed membership models with discrete
    multivariate data (with or without repeated measures) following the general
    framework of Erosheva 2004. This package uses a Variational EM approach by
    approximating the posterior distribution of latent memberships and
    selecting hyperparameters through a pseudo-MLE procedure. Currently
    supported data types are Bernoulli, multinomial and rank (Plackett-Luce).
