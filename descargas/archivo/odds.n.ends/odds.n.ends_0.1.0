Description: Computes odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals from a generalized linear model object. It also computes model significance with the chi-squared statistic and p-value and it computes model fit using a contingency table to determine the percent of observations for which the model correctly predicts the value of the outcome. Calculates model sensitivity and specificity.
