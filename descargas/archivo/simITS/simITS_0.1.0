Description: Uses simulation to create prediction intervals for
    post-policy outcomes in interrupted time series (ITS) designs,
    following Miratrix (2020) <arXiv:2002.05746>. This package provides
    methods for fitting ITS models with lagged outcomes and variables to
    account for temporal dependencies.  It then conducts inference via
    simulation, simulating a set of plausible counterfactual post-policy
    series to compare to the observed post-policy series. This package
    also provides methods to visualize such data, and also to incorporate
    seasonality models and smoothing and aggregation/summarization.  This
    work partially funded by Arnold Ventures in collaboration with
    MDRC.
