Description: Computes the influence functions time series of the returns for the risk and 
             performance measures as mentioned in Zhang and Martin (2017) 
             <https://ssrn.com/abstract=2747179> as well as Chen and Martin (2018) 
             <https://ssrn.com/abstract=3085672>. Also evaluates estimators influence
             functions at a set of parameter values and plots them to display the shapes of 
             the influence functions.
