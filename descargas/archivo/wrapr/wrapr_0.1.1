Description: Provides 'DebugFnW()' to capture function context on error for
    debugging, and 'let()' which converts non-standard evaluation interfaces to
    standard evaluation interfaces.
    'DebugFnW()' captures the calling function and arguments prior to the 
    call causing the exception, while 
    the classic `options(error=dump.frames)` form captures at the
    moment of the exception
    itself (thus function arguments may not be at their starting values).
    `let()` rebinds (possibly unbound) names to names, which is different than
    `with()` rebinds names to values.
