Description: This package solves systems of delay differential equations. 
   by interfacing numerical routines written by Simon N. Wood , with 
   contributions by Benjamin J. Cairns. These numerical routines first 
   appeared in Simon Wood's solv95 program.
   This package includes a vignette and a complete user's guide. 
   'PBSddesolve' originally appeared on CRAN under the name 'ddesolve'.
   That version is no longer supported. The current name emphasizes a close 
   association with other PBS packages, particularly 'PBSmodelling'.
