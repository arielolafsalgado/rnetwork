Description: Perform common JavaScript operations in Shiny
    applications without having to know any JavaScript. Examples include: hiding an
    element, disabling an input, resetting an input back to its original value,
    delaying code execution by a few seconds, and many more useful functions.
    'shinyjs' can also be used to easily run your own custom JavaScript functions
    from R.
