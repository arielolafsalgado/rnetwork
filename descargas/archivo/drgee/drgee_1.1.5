Description: Fit restricted mean models for the conditional association
  between an exposure and an outcome, given covariates. Three methods
  are implemented: O-estimation, where a nuisance model for the
  association between the covariates and the outcome is used;
  E-estimation where a nuisance model for the association
  between the covariates and the exposure is used, and doubly robust (DR)
  estimation where both nuisance models are used. In DR-estimation,
  the estimates will be consistent when at least one of the nuisance
  models is correctly specified, not necessarily both.
