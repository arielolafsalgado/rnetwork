Description: The main purpose of the package is to categorize a numeric variable into bins
    mapped to a binary target variable for its ulterior usage in scoring modeling. 
    This functionality reduces dramatically the time consuming process of finding the optimal 
    cut points for a given numeric variable, quickly calculates the Information Value, either for
    one variable at the time or all at once in one line of code; and also outputs 'SQL' codes, 
    tables, and plots used throughout the development stage.
    The package also allows the user to understand the data via exploratory data analysis 
    in one step, establish customized cut points for numeric characteristics, and run the analysis 
    for categorical variables.
