Description: A set of functions to build a scoring model from beginning to end, leading the user
	to follow an efficient and organized development process, reducing significantly the time
	spent on data exploration, variable selection, feature engineering and binning, among other 
	recurrent tasks. 
	The package also incorporates scaling capabilities that transforms logistic coefficients
	into points for a better business understanding and calculates and visualizes classic performance
	metrics of a classification model.
