Title: Optimal Thresholding Fisher's P-Value Combination Method
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Hong Zhang and Zheyang Wu
Maintainer: Hong Zhang <hzhang@wpi.edu>
Description: We provide the cumulative distribution function (CDF),
    quantile, and statistical power calculator for a collection of 
    thresholding Fisher's p-value combination methods, including Fisher's 
    p-value combination method, truncated product method and, in particular, soft-thresholding
    Fisher's p-value combination method which is proven to be optimal in some
    context of signal detection. The p-value calculator for the omnibus version
    of these tests are also included. For reference, please see Hong Zhang and Zheyang Wu. "Optimal Thresholding of Fisher's P-value Combination Tests for Signal Detection", submitted.
