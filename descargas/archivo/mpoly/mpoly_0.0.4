Description: mpoly allows for the symbolic manipulation of multivariate
    polynomials in a general and consistent way designed especially for
    sparse and super sparse polynomials.  It also allows for basic
    differential calculus with multivariate polynomials and Grobner basis
    calculations from computational algebraic geometry.
Imports: stringr, rSymPy, rJython, rJava, rjson, partitions, plyr,
