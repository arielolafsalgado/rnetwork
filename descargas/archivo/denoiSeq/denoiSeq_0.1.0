Description: Given count data from two conditions, it determines which transcripts are differentially expressed across the two conditions using Bayesian inference of the parameters of  a bottom-up model for PCR amplification. This model is  developed in Ndifon Wilfred, Hilah Gal, Eric Shifrut, Rina Aharoni, Nissan Yissachar, Nir Waysbort, Shlomit Reich Zeliger, Ruth Arnon, and Nir Friedman (2012), <http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15865.full>, and results in a distribution for the counts that is a superposition of the binomial and negative binomial distribution.
