Description: R package for simulation of IBD sharing among family members. Using sex specific recombination rates from the Decode map (2010) of the human genome, phased chromosomes are simulated for all pedigree members, either by unconditional 'gene dropping' or conditional on a specified IBD pattern. Regions compatible with the query IBD pattern (possibly different from the conditional pattern) are subsequently detected and summarized.
