Description: B Cell Receptor Somatik Hyper Mutation Analysis provide analysis
    of nucleotide frequency, transition, transversion, reconstruction of germline
    sequences based on IMGT outputs, calculate and plot the percentage difference
    at 6 positions to a nucleotide mutation to identify the hotspot motifs and
    calculate and plot average mutation frequency of nucleotide mutations resulting
    in amino acid substitution.
