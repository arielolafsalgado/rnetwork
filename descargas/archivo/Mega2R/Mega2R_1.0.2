Title: Accessing and Processing a 'Mega2' Genetic Database
Description: Uses as input genetic data that have been reformatted
     and stored in a 'SQLite' database; this database is initially
     created by the standalone 'mega2' C++ program (available freely
     from <https://watson.hgen.pitt.edu/register/>). Loads and
     manipulates data frames containing genotype, phenotype, and family
     information from the input 'SQLite' database, and decompresses
     needed subsets of the genotype data, on the fly, in a memory
     efficient manner.  We have also created several more functions that
     illustrate how to use the data frames as well as perform useful
     tasks: these permit one to run the 'pedgene' package to carry out
     gene-based association tests on family data using selected marker
     subsets, to run the 'SKAT' package to carry out gene-based
     association tests using selected marker subsets, to output the
     'Mega2R' data as a VCF file and related files (for phenotype and
     family data), and to convert the data frames into 'GenABEL'
     gwaa.data-class objects.
