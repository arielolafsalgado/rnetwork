Description: Provides tools to enable the researcher to more precisely conduct
    respirometry experiments. Strong emphasis is on aquatic respirometry. Tools
    focus on helping the researcher setup and conduct experiments. Analysis of the
    resulting data is not a focus since analyses are often specific to a particular
    setup, and thus are better created by the researcher individually. This
    package provides tools for intermittent, flow-through, and closed respirometry
    techniques.
