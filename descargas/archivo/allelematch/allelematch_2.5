        and missing data may be present

Description: This package provides tools for the identification of unique of multilocus genotypes when both genotyping error and missing data may be present. The package is targeted at those working with large datasets and databases containing multiple samples of each individual, a situation that is common in conservation genetics, and particularly in non-invasive wildlife sampling applications. Functions explicitly incorporate missing data, and can tolerate allele mismatches created by genotyping error. If you use this tool, please cite the package using the journal article in Molecular Ecology Resources (Galpern et al., 2012).  Please use citation('allelematch') to find this. Due to changing CRAN policy, and the size and compile time of the vignettes, they can no longer be distributed with this package.  Please contact the package primary author, or visit the allelematch site for a complete vignette (http://nricaribou.cc.umanitoba.ca/allelematch/).  For users with access to academic literature, tutorial material is also available as supplementary material to the article describing this software.
