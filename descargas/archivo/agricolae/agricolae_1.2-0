Description: Agricolae was presented in the thesis "A statistical analysis tool for agricultural research" to obtain the degree of Master on science, mention Systems Engineering, Faculty of Industrial and Systems Engineering, National Engineering University (UNI), Lima-Peru. Original idea, support and data sets came from CIP (International Potato Center). Agricolae offers extensive functionality on experimental design especially for agricultural and plant breeding experiments, which can also be useful for other purposes. It supports planning of lattice, Alpha, Cyclic, Complete Block, Latin Square, Graeco-Latin Squares, augmented block, factorial, split and strip plot designs.
