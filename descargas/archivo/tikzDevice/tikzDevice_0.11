Description: Provides a graphics output device for R that records plots
        in a LaTeX-friendly format. The device transforms plotting
        commands issued by R functions into LaTeX code blocks. When
        included in a LaTeX document, these blocks are interpreted with
        the help of 'TikZ'---a graphics package for TeX and friends
        written by Till Tantau. Using the 'tikzDevice', the text of R
        plots can contain LaTeX commands such as mathematical formula.
        The device also allows arbitrary LaTeX code to be inserted into
        the output stream.
