Description: Implements Bayesian inference for the conditional genetic 
    stock identification model.  It allows inference of mixed fisheries and also 
    simulation of mixtures to predict accuracy.  A full description of the underlying
    methods is in review at Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences.
