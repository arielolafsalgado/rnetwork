Description: Implements our Bayesian phase I repeated measurement design that accounts for multidimensional toxicity endpoints from multiple treatment cycles. The package also provides a novel design to account for both multidimensional toxicity endpoints and early-stage efficacy endpoints in the phase I design. For both designs, functions are provided to recommend the next dosage selection based on the data collected in the available patient cohorts and to simulate trial characteristics given design parameters.
