Description: Simple methods to generate attractive random colors. The random
  colors are from a wrapper of 'randomColor.js'
  <https://github.com/davidmerfield/randomColor>. In addition, it also generates
  optimally distinct colors based on k-means (inspired by 'IWantHue'
  <https://github.com/medialab/iwanthue>).
