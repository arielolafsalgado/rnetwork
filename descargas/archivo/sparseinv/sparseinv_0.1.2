Description: Creates a wrapper for the 'SuiteSparse' routines 
    that execute the Takahashi equations. These equations compute the
    elements of the inverse of a sparse matrix at locations where the
    its Cholesky factor is non-zero. The resulting matrix is known as a 
	sparse inverse subset. Some helper functions are also implemented. 
	Support for spam matrices is currently limited and will be implemented 
	in the future. See Rue and Martino (2007) <doi:10.1016/j.jspi.2006.07.016> 
	and Zammit-Mangion and Rougier (2018) <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2018.02.001> for the 
	application of these equations to statistics.
