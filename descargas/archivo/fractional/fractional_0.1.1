Title: Vulgar Fractions in R
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Bill Venables
Maintainer: Bill Venables <bill.venables@gmail.com>
Description: The main function of this package allows numerical vector objects to
  be displayed with their values in vulgar fractional form.  This is convenient if
  patterns can then be more easily detected.  In
  some cases replacing the components of a numeric vector by a rational
  approximation can also be expected to remove some component of round-off error.
  The main functions form a re-implementation of the functions 'fractions' and
  'rational' of the MASS package, but using a radically improved programming strategy.
