Description: Implements wavelet-based approaches for describing population admixture. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used to define the population structure and produce a localized admixture signal for each individual. Wavelet summaries of the PCA output describe variation present in the data and can be related to population-level demographic processes. For more details, see accompanying paper.
