Description: Calculation routines based on the FOCUS Kinetics Report (2006).
  Includes a function for conveniently defining differential equation models,
  model solution based on eigenvalues if possible or using numerical solvers
  and a choice of the optimisation methods made available by the 'FME' package.
  If a C compiler (on windows: 'Rtools') is installed, differential
  equation models are solved using compiled C functions.  
  Please note that no warranty is implied for correctness of results or fitness
  for a particular purpose.
