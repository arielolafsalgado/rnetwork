Description: An integrated editing and imputation method for continuous microdata under linear constraints is implemented. It relies on a Bayesian nonparametric hierarchical modeling approach as described in Kim et al. (2015) <DOI:10.1080/01621459.2015.1040881>. In this approach, the joint distribution of the data is estimated by a flexible joint probability model. The generated edit-imputed data are guaranteed to satisfy all imposed edit rules, whose types include ratio edits, balance edits and range restrictions.
