Description: Provides a routine to concentrate out factors with many levels during the
  optimization of the log-likelihood function of the corresponding generalized linear model (glm).
  The package is based on the algorithm proposed by Stammann (2018) <arXiv:1707.01815> and is
  restricted to glm's that are based on maximum likelihood estimation and non-linear. It also offers
  an efficient algorithm to recover estimates of the fixed effects in a post-estimation routine.
  The package also includes robust and multi-way clustered standard errors.
