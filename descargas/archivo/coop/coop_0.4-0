Title: Co-Operation: Fast Covariance, Correlation, and Cosine
        Similarity Operations
Version: 0.4-0
Description: Fast implementations of the co-operations: covariance,
    correlation, and cosine similarity.  The implementations are
    fast and memory-efficient and their use is resolved
    automatically based on the input data, handled by R's S3
    methods.  Full descriptions of the algorithms and benchmarks
    are available in the package vignettes.
