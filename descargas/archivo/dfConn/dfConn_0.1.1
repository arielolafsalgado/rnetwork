Description: An implementation of multivariate linear process bootstrap (MLPB) method and sliding window technique to assess the dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) estimate by providing its confidence bands, based on Maria Kudela (2017) <doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.01.056>.
  It also integrates features to visualize non-zero coverage for selected a-priori regions of interest estimated by the dynamic functional connectivity model (dFCM) and dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) curves for reward-related a-priori regions of interest where the activation-based analysis reported.
