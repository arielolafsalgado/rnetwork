Description: Contains functions that fit linear mixed-effects models
        for high-dimensional data (p>>n) with penalty for both the fixed effects and random effects for variable selection. 
        The details of the algorithm can be found in Luoying Yang PhD thesis (available soon). The algorithm implementation
        is based on the R package 'lmmlasso'.
