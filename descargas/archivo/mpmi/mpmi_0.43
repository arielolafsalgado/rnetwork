Description: Uses a kernel smoothing approach to calculate Mutual Information
    for comparisons between all types of variables including continuous vs
    continuous, continuous vs discrete and discrete vs discrete. Uses a
    nonparametric bias correction giving Bias Corrected Mutual Information
    (BCMI). Implemented efficiently in Fortran 95 with OpenMP and suited to
    large genomic datasets.
