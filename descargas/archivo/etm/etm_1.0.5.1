Title: Empirical Transition Matrix
Version: 1.0.5.1
Author: Arthur Allignol
Description: The etm (empirical transition matrix) package permits to estimate the matrix of transition probabilities for any time-inhomogeneous multistate model with finite state space using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. Functions for data preparation and for displaying are also included (Allignol et al., 2011 <doi:10.18637/jss.v038.i04>). Functionals of the Aalen-Johansen estimator, e.g., excess length-of-stay in an intermediate state, can also be computed (Allignol et al. 2011 <doi:10.1007/s00180-010-0200-x>).
