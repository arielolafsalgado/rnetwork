Description: HTML documents can be beautiful and pristine. They can also be
    wretched, evil, malformed demon-spawn. Now, you can tidy up that HTML and XHTML
    before processing it with your favorite angle-bracket crunching tools, going beyond
    the limited tidying that 'libxml2' affords in the 'XML' and 'xml2' packages and
    taming even the ugliest HTML code generated by the likes of Google Docs and Microsoft
    Word. It's also possible to use the functions provided to format or "pretty print"
    HTML content as it is being tidied.
