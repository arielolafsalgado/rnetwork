Description: Implements a wide range of model-based dose
    escalation designs, ranging from classical and modern continual
    reassessment methods (CRMs) based on dose-limiting toxicity endpoints to
    dual-endpoint designs taking into account a biomarker/efficacy outcome. The
    focus is on Bayesian inference, making it very easy to setup a new design
    with its own JAGS code. However, it is also possible to implement 3+3
    designs for comparison or models with non-Bayesian estimation. The whole
    package is written in a modular form in the S4 class system, making it very
    flexible for adaptation to new models, escalation or stopping rules.
