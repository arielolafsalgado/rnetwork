Package: redux
Title: R Bindings to 'hiredis'
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Rich FitzJohn
Maintainer: Rich FitzJohn <rich.fitzjohn@gmail.com>
Description: A 'hiredis' wrapper that includes support for
    transactions, pipelining, blocking subscription, serialisation of
    all keys and values, 'Redis' error handling with R errors.
    Includes an automatically generated 'R6' interface to the full
    'hiredis' 'API'.  Generated functions are faithful to the
    'hiredis' documentation while attempting to match R's argument
    semantics.  Serialisation must be explicitly done by the user, but
    both binary and text-mode serialisation is supported.
