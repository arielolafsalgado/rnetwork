Description: We provide a rich collection of linear and nonlinear
    dimension reduction techniques implemented using 'RcppArmadillo'.
    The question on what we should use as the target dimension is
    addressed by intrinsic dimension estimation methods introduced as well.
    For more details on dimensionality techniques, see the paper by
    Ma and Zhu (2013) <doi:10.1111/j.1751-5823.2012.00182.x> if you are interested in
    statistical approach, or Engel, Huttenberger, and Hamann (2012)
    <doi:10.4230/OASIcs.VLUDS.2011.135> for a broader cross-disciplinary overview.
