Description: Functions for combining survival curves of competing risks to produce cumulative incidence
  and event-free probability functions, and for summarizing and plotting the results. Survival curves
  can be either time-denominated or probability-denominated. Point estimates as well as Bayesian, sample-based
  representations of survival can utilize this framework.
