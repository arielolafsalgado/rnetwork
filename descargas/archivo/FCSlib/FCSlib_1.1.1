Description: 
    A set of tools for fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy data analysis performance is provided in this package.
    It includes techniques such as single-point fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, autocorrelation and pair correlation functions, number & brightness (raster line scan) and a novel, recently developed method by Hinde and co-workers, pair correlation of molecular brightness (doi:10.1038/ncomms11047).
    A set of simulations and real experimental data is used for the examples of each function provided in this package.
    For an in-depth description of the basics behind each function here included and a detailed step-by-step guide on how to use them on your own data, please refer to the Supplementary Material file provided at (<https://github.com/RPintoC/FCSlib>).
