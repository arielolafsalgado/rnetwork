Description: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a program aimed at improving our understanding of Cancer Biology. Several TCGA Datasets are available online. 'TCGAretriever' helps accessing and downloading TCGA data via the 'cBioPortal' Web Interface (see <http://www.cbioportal.org/web_api.jsp> for more information). Features of 'TCGAretriever' include: 1) it is very simple to use (get all the TCGA data you need with a few lines of code); 2) performance (smooth and reliable data download via 'httr'); 3) it is tailored for downloading large volumes of data.
