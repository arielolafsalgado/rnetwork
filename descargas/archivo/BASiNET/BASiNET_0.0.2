Description: The methodology applied in this package starts with the creation of networks from RNA sequences, in this way the extraction of resources from these networks is performed with a threshold methodology, aiming to make a classification between the classes of the sequences. There are two data present in the package, "sequences" and "sequences2" with 11 and 10 sequences respectively. These sequences were taken from the data set used in the article (LI, Aimin; ZHANG, Junying; ZHOU, Zhongyin, 2014) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-311>.
