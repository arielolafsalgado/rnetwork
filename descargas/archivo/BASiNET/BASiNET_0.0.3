Description: It makes the creation of networks from sequences of RNA, with this is done the abstraction of characteristics of these networks with a methodology of threshold for the purpose of making a classification between the classes of the sequences. There are two data present in the 'BASiNET' package, "sequences" and "sequences2" with 11 and 10 sequences respectively. These sequences were taken from the data set used in the article (LI, Aimin; ZHANG, Junying; ZHOU, Zhongyin, 2014) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-15-311>. These sequences are used to run examples.
