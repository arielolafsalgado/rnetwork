Description: Process spatially- and temporally-discrete data into contact and 
   social networks, and facilitate network analysis by randomizing 
   individuals' movement paths and/or related categorical variables. To use 
   this package, users need only have a dataset containing spatial data 
   (i.e., latitude/longitude, or planar x & y coordinates), individual IDs 
   relating spatial data to specific individuals, and date/time information 
   relating spatial locations to temporal locations. The functionality of this 
   package ranges from data "cleaning" via multiple filtration functions, to 
   spatial and temporal data interpolation, and network creation and analysis. 
   Functions within this package are not limited to describing interpersonal 
   contacts. Package functions can also identify and quantify "contacts" 
   between individuals and fixed areas (e.g., home ranges, water bodies, 
   buildings, etc.). As such, this package is an incredibly useful resource 
   for facilitating epidemiological, ecological, ethological and sociological 
   research.
