Description: An efficient method of recovering precision matrices
             by applying the parametric simplex method is provided in this package. 
             The computation is based on a linear optimization solver. 
             It also contains a generic Linear Programming solver and a 
             parameterized Linear Programming solver based on the parametric simplex method.
