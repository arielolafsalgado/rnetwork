Title: An R 'Deque' Container
Version: 1.0
Description: Offers a special data structure called a 'deque'
    (pronounced like 'deck'), which is a list-like structure.  However,
    unlike R's list structure, data put into a 'deque' is not necessarily
    stored contiguously, making insertions and deletions at the front/end
    of the structure much faster.  The implementation here is new and 
    uses a doubly linked list, and whence does not rely on R's
    environments.  To avoid unnecessary data copying, most 'deque'
    operations are performed via side-effects.
