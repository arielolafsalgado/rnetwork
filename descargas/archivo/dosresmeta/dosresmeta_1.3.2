Description: It estimates a dose-response relation from either a single or
    multiple summarized data. The trend estimation takes into account the
    correlation among sets of log relative risks and use it to efficiently
    estimate the dose-response relation. To obtain a pooled functional
    relation, the study-specific trends are combined according to principles of
    multivariate random-effects meta-analysis.
