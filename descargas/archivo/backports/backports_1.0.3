Title: Reimplementations of Functions Introduced Since R-3.0.0
Version: 1.0.3
Author: Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Michel Lang <michellang@gmail.com>
Description: Provides implementations of functions which have been introduced in
    R since version 3.0.0. The backports are conditionally exported which
    results in R resolving the function names to the version shipped with R (if
    available) and uses the implemented backports as fallback. This way package
    developers can make use of the new functions without worrying about the
    minimum required R version.
