Title: Functions and Datasets to Accompany Hollander, Wolfe, and
        Chicken - Nonparametric Statistical Methods, Third Edition
Author: Grant Schneider, Eric Chicken, Rachel Becvarik
Maintainer: Grant Schneider <schneider.393@osu.edu>
Description: Designed to replace the tables which were in the back of the first two editions of Hollander and Wolfe - Nonparametric Statistical Methods.  Exact procedures are performed when computationally possible.  Monte Carlo and Asymptotic procedures are performed otherwise.  For those procedures included in the base packages, our code simply provides a wrapper to standardize the output with the other procedures in the package.
