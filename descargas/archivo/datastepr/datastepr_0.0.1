Title: An Implementation of a SAS-Style Data Step
Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2015-06-01
Author: Brandon Taylor
Maintainer: Brandon Taylor <brandon.taylor221@gmail.com>
Description: Based on a SAS data step. This allows for row-wise dynamic building of data, iteratively importing slices of existing dataframes, conducting analyses, and exporting to a results frame. This is particularly useful for differential or time-series analyses, which are often not well suited to vector-based operations.
