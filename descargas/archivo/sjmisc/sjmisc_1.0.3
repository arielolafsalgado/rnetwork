Description: Collection of several utility functions (especially intended for
             people coming from other statistical software packages like 'SPSS',
             and/or who are new to R), supporting following common tasks:
             1) Reading and writing data between R and other statistical software packages
             like 'SPSS', 'SAS' or 'Stata' and working with labelled data; this includes easy
             ways to get and set label attributes, to convert labelled vectors into
             factors (and vice versa) etc.
             2) Data transformation tasks like recoding, dichotomizing or
             grouping variables, setting and replacing missing values.
             3) Convenient functions to perform frequently used statistical tests,
             or to calculate various commonly used statistical coefficients.
