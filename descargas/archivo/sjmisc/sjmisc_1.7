Description: Collection of miscellaneous utility functions (especially intended
    for people coming from other statistical software packages like 'SPSS', and/
    or who are new to R), supporting following common tasks: 1) Reading and writing
    data between R and other statistical software packages like 'SPSS', 'SAS' or
    'Stata' and working with labelled data; this includes easy ways to get and set
    label attributes, to convert labelled vectors into factors (and vice versa),
    or to deal with multiple declared missing values etc. 2) Data transformation
    tasks like recoding, dichotomizing or grouping variables, setting and replacing
    missing values. 3) Convenient functions to perform frequently used statistical
    tests, or to calculate various commonly used statistical coefficients.
