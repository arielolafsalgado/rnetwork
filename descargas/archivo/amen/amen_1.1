Title: Additive and Multiplicative Effects Models for Networks and
        Relational Data
Version: 1.1
Description: Analysis of dyadic network and relational data using additive and
   multiplicative effects (AME) models. The basic model includes
   regression terms, the covariance structure of the social relations model
   (Warner, Kenny and Stoto (1979), Wong (1982)), and multiplicative factor
   models (Hoff(2009)). Four different link functions accommodate different
   relational data structures, including binary/network data (bin), normal
   relational data (nrm), ordinal relational data (ord) and data from
   fixed-rank nomination schemes (frn).  Several of these link functions are
   discussed in Hoff, Fosdick, Volfovsky and Stovel (2013). Development of this
   software was supported in part by NIH grant R01HD067509.
