Title: Tools for Fitting Sparse Latent Factor Model
Version: 0.2.1
Author: Joao Duarte and Vinicius Mayrink
Maintainer: Joao Duarte <jdanielnd@gmail.com>
Description: Set of tools to find coherent patterns in microarray data
    using a Bayesian sparse latent factor model (Duarte and Mayrink 2015 -
    http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-12454-4_15).
    Considerable effort has been put into making slfm fast and memory efficient,
    turning it an interesting alternative to simpler methods in terms
    of execution time. It implements versions of the SLFM using both type
    of mixtures: using a degenerate distribution or a very concentrated
    normal distribution for the spike part of the mixture. It also implements
    additional functions to help pre-process the data and fit the model
    for a large number of arrays.
