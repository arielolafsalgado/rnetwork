Description: Implements a screening procedure proposed by Wanghuan Chu, Runze Li
    and Matthew Reimherr (2016) <DOI:10.1214/16-AOAS912> for varying coefficient
    longitudinal models with ultra-high dimensional predictors . The effect of each
    predictor is allowed to vary over time, approximated by a low-dimensional B-spline.
    Within-subject correlation is handled using a generalized estimation equation
    approach with structure specified by the user. Variance is allowed to change
    over time, also approximated by a B-spline.
