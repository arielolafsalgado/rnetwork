Description: Implements a screening procedure proposed by Chu, Li, and
    Reimherr (2016) for varying coefficient longitudinal models with ultra-
    high dimensional predictors <http://imstat.org/aoas/next_issue.html>.
    The effect of each predictor is allowed to vary over time, approximated by a
    low-dimensional B-spline. Within-subject correlation is handled using a
    generalized estimation equation approach with structure specified by the user.
    Variance is allowed to change over time, also approximated by a B-spline.
