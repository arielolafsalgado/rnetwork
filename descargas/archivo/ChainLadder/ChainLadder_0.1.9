Description: Various statistical methods and models which are 
    typically used for the estimation of outstanding claims reserves 
    in general insurance. The package has implementations of the Mack, 
    Munich, Bootstrap, multivariate, and chain-ladder factor models (CLFM),
    as well as the loss development factor curve fitting methods of 
    Dave Clark and generalised linear model based reserving models.
