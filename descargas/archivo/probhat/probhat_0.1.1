Description: Computes nonparametric probability distributions (probability density functions, cumulative distribution functions and quantile functions) using kernel smoothing. Supports univariate, multivariate and conditional distributions, and weighted data (possibly useful mixed with fuzzy clustering or frequency data). Also, supports empirical continuous cumulative distribution functions and their inverses, and random number generation.
