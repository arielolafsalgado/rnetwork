Description: Constructs, plots and evaluates probability distributions (probability mass/density functions, cumulative distribution functions and quantile functions) with continuous kernel smoothing, and to a lesser extent, discrete kernel smoothing. Supports univariate, multivariate and conditional distributions, including multivariate-conditional distributions. Also, supports other probability distributions (categorical, frequency and empirical-like) and weighted data, which is possibly useful mixed with fuzzy clustering. Furthermore, there are extensions for computing multivariate probabilities and multivariate random numbers, and for parameter and mode estimation.
