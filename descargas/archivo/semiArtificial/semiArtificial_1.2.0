Description: Package semiArtificial contains methods to generate and evaluate semi-artificial data sets. 
 Based on a given data set different methods learn data properties using machine learning algorithms and
 generate new data with the same properties.
 The package currently includes the following data generator:
  -a RBF network based generator using rbfDDA from RSNNS package.
 More generators are planned in near future.
 Data evaluation support tools include:
  -single attribute based statistical evaluation: mean, median,standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, KS test, Hellinger distance
  -evaluation based on clustering using Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)
  -evaluation based on classification performance with various learning models, eg, random forests.
