Description: Generates formatted summary tables for vectors and dataframes.
    Three summarizing functions: 1) 'freq' generates frequency tables
    reporting counts and proportions (including cumulative); 2) 'descr'
    gives common central tendency statistics and measures of dispersion
    for numerical data; 3) 'dfSummary' which attempts to give as much
    information as possible about a dataframe and its components in a clear,
    legible table. All three functions can either display plain text tables
    in the console or write markdown, text or html files to disk. An
    additional misc function, 'what.is', extends base 'is' function,
    checking the object against all 'is' functions.
