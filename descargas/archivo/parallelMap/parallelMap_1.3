Package: parallelMap
Title: Unified Interface to Parallelization Back-Ends
Description: Unified parallelization framework for multiple back-end,
  designed for internal package and interactive usage.
    The main operation is a parallel "map" over lists.
    Supports local, multicore, mpi and BatchJobs mode.
    Allows "tagging" of the parallel operation
    with a level name that can be later selected by the user to
    switch on parallel execution for exactly this operation.
