Description: Maximum likelihood estimation of an extended class of row-column (RC) association models for two-dimensional contingency tables, which are formulated by a condition of reduced rank on a matrix of extended association parameters; see Forcina (2019) <arXiv:1910.13848>. These parameters are defined by choosing the logit type for the row and column variables among four different options and a transformation derived from suitable divergence measures.
