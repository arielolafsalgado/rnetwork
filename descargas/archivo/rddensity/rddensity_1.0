Title: Manipulation Testing Based on Density Discontinuity
Description: Density discontinuity test (a.k.a. manipulation test) is commonly employed in regression discontinuity designs and other program evaluation settings to detect whether there is evidence of perfect self-selection (manipulation) around a cutoff where a treatment/policy assignment changes. This package provides tools for conducting the aforementioned statistical test: rddensity() to construct local polynomial based density discontinuity test given a prespecified cutoff, rdbwdensity() to perform bandwidth selection, and rdplotdensity() to construct density plot near the cutoff.
