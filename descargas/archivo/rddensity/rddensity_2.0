Title: Manipulation Testing Based on Density Discontinuity
Description: Density discontinuity testing (a.k.a. manipulation testing) is commonly employed in regression discontinuity designs and other program evaluation settings to detect perfect self-selection (manipulation) around a cutoff where treatment/policy assignment changes. This package implements manipulation testing procedures using the local polynomial density estimators: rddensity() to construct test statistics and p-values given a prespecified cutoff, rdbwdensity() to perform data-driven bandwidth selection, and rdplotdensity() to construct density plots.
