Description: A generic reference Bayesian analysis of unidimensional mixtures of Gaussian distributions obtained by a location-scale parameterisation of the model is implemented. Included functions can be applied to produce a Bayesian analysis of Gaussian mixtures with an arbitrary number of components, with no need to define the prior distribution.
