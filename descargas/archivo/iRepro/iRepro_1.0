Description: This package calculates intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for assessing reproducibility of interval-censored data with two repeated measurements. ICC is estimated by maximum likelihood from model with one fixed and one random effect (both intercepts). Help in model checking (normality of subjects' means and residuals) is provided.
