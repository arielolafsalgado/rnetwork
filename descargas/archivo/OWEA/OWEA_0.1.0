Description: An implementation of optimal weight exchange algorithm Yang(2013) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2013.806268> for three models.
    They are Crossover model with subject dropout, crossover model with proportional
    first order residual effects and interference model. You can use it to find either
    A-opt or D-opt approximate designs. Exact designs can be automatically rounded
    from approximate designs and relative efficiency is provided as well.
