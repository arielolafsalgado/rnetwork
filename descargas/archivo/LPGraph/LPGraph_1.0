Description: A nonparametric method to approximate Laplacian graph spectra of a network with 
    ordered vertices. This provides a computationally efficient algorithm for obtaining an 
	accurate and smooth estimate of the graph Laplacian basis. The approximation results can 
	then be used for tasks like change point detection, k-sample testing, and so on. The 
	primary reference is Mukhopadhyay, S. and Wang, K. (2018, Technical Report).
