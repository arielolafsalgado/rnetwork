Description: This is a simple package for Flux Balance Analysis and related 
    metabolic modelling techniques. Functions are provided for: parsing 
    models in tabular format, converting parsed metabolic models to input 
    formats for common linear programming solvers, and 
    evaluating and applying gene-protein-reaction mappings. In addition, there 
    are wrappers to parse a model, select a solver, find the metabolic fluxes, 
    and return the results applied to the original model. Compared to other 
    packages in this field, this package puts a much heavier focus on 
    providing reusable components that can be used in the design of new 
    implementation of new techniques, in particular those that involve large 
    parameter sweeps.
