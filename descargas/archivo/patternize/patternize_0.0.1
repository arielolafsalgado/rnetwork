Description: Quantification of variation in organismal color patterns as obtained from image data. 
    Patternize defines homology between pattern positions across images either through 
    fixed landmarks or image registration. Pattern identification is performed by 
    categorizing the distribution of colors using either an RGB threshold or unsupervised 
    image segmentation.
