Description: Implements a method for identifying and removing
				the cell-cycle effect from scRNA-Seq data. The description of the 
				method is in Barron M. and Li J. (2016) <doi:10.1038/srep33892>. Identifying and removing 
				the cell-cycle effect from single-cell RNA-Sequencing data. Submitted. 
				Different from previous methods, ccRemover implements a mechanism that
				formally tests whether a component is cell-cycle related or not, and thus
				while it often thoroughly removes the cell-cycle effect, it preserves
				other features/signals of interest in the data.
