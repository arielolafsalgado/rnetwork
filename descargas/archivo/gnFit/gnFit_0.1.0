Title: Goodness of Fit Test for Continuous Distribution Functions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Ali Saeb
Maintainer: Ali Saeb <ali.saeb@gmail.com>
Description: Computes the test statistic and p-value of the Cramer-von Mises and Anderson-Darling test for some continuous distribution functions proposed by Chen and Balakrishnan (1995) <http://asq.org/qic/display-item/index.html?item=11407>. In addition to our classic distribution functions here, we  calculate the Goodness of Fit (GoF) test to dataset which follows the extreme value distribution function, without remembering the formula of distribution/density functions.
