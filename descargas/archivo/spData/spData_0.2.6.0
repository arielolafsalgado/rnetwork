Description: Diverse spatial datasets for demonstrating, benchmarking and teaching spatial data analysis. 
        It includes R data of class sf (defined by the package 'sf'), Spatial (sp), and nb (spdep).
        Unlike other spatial data packages such as 'rnaturalearth' and 'maps', 
        it also contains data stored in a range of file formats including GeoJSON, ESRI Shapefile and GeoPackage. 
        Some of the datasets are designed to illustrate specific analysis techniques.
        cycle_hire and cycle_hire_osm, for example, is designed to illustrate point pattern analysis techniques.
        This package interacts with data available through the 'spDataLarge' package, 
        which is available in a 'drat' repository. To access this data package, 
        run 'install.packages("spDataLarge", repos = "https://nowosad.github.io/drat/", type = "source")'. 
        The size of the 'spDataLarge' package is approximately 20 MB. 
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0)
Suggests: foreign, maptools, rgdal, sf, sp, spDataLarge (>= 0.2.3.0),
        spdep
