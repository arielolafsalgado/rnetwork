Title: Visualisation of Sequential Probability Distributions Using Fan
        Charts
Version: 3.4.1
Author: Guy J. Abel
Maintainer: "Guy J. Abel" <g.j.abel@gmail.com>
Description: Visualise sequential distributions using a range of plotting
    styles. Sequential distribution data can be input as either simulations or
    values corresponding to percentiles over time. Plots are added to
    existing graphic devices using the fan function. Users can choose from four
    different styles, including fan chart type plots, where a set of coloured
    polygon, with shadings corresponding to the percentile values are layered
    to represent different uncertainty levels.
