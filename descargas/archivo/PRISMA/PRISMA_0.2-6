Description: Loads and processes huge text
    corpora processed with the sally toolbox (<http://www.mlsec.org/sally/>).
    sally acts as a very fast preprocessor which splits the text files into
    tokens or n-grams. These output files can then be read with the PRISMA
    package which applies testing-based token selection and has some
    replicate-aware, highly tuned non-negative matrix factorization and
    principal component analysis implementation which allows the processing of
    very big data sets even on desktop machines.
