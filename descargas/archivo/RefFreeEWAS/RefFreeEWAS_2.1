Description: 
    Reference-free method for conducting EWAS while deconvoluting DNA methylation arising as mixtures of cell types.  
   The older method (Houseman et al., 2014,<doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu029>) is similar to surrogate variable analysis (SVA and ISVA), except that it makes additional use of a biological mixture assumption.
   The newer method (Houseman et al., 2016, <doi:10.1186/s12859-016-1140-4>) is similar to non-negative matrix factorization, with additional constraints and additional utilities.
