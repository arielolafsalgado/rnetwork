Description: 
    Reference-free method for conducting EWAS while deconvoluting DNA methylation arising as mixtures of cell types.  
   The older method (Houseman et al., 2014) is similar to surrogate variable analysis (SVA and ISVA), except that it makes additional use of a biological mixture assumption.
   The newer method (Houseman et al., 2016) is similar to non-negative matrix factorization, with additional constraints and additional utilities.
