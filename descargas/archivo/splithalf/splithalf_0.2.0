Description: A series of functions to calculate the split 
    half reliability of RT based tasks. The core function performs a Monte Carlo
    procedure to process a user defined number of random splits in order to 
    provide a better reliability estimate. The current functions target the dot-
    probe task, however, can be modified for other tasks.
