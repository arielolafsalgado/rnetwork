Description: Single linkage clustering and connected component analyses are often performed on biological images. 'Bioi' provides a set of functions for performing these tasks. This functionality is implemented in several key functions that can extend to from 1 to many dimensions. The single linkage clustering method implemented here can be used on n-dimensional data sets, while connected component analyses are limited to 3 or fewer dimensions.
