Description: 
  Functions to combine data.frames in ways that require additional effort in 
  base R, and to add metadata (id, title, ...) that can be used for printing and 
  xlsx export. The 'Tatoo_report' class is provided as a 
  convenient helper to write several such tables to a workbook, one table per 
  worksheet.
