Description: The heterogeneous treatment effect estimation procedure 
        proposed by Imai and Ratkovic (2013).  
        The proposed method is applicable, for
        example, when selecting a small number of most (or least)
        efficacious treatments from a large number of alternative
        treatments as well as when identifying subsets of the
        population who benefit (or are harmed by) a treatment of
        interest. The method adapts the Support Vector Machine
        classifier by placing separate LASSO constraints over the
        pre-treatment parameters and causal heterogeneity parameters of
        interest. This allows for the qualitative distinction between
        causal and other parameters, thereby making the variable
        selection suitable for the exploration of causal heterogeneity. 
	The package also contains the function, INT, which estimates 
	the average marginal treatment effect, the average treatment 
	combination effect, and the average marginal treatment interaction
	effect proposed by Egami and Imai (2015).
