Description: In self-reported data the user often encounters heaped data, i.e. data which are rounded to a different
 degree of coarseness. While this is mostly a minor problem in parametric density estimation the bias can be very large
 for non-parametric methods such as kernel density estimation. This package implements a partly Bayesian algorithm treating the true unknown values as additional
 parameters and estimates the rounding parameters to give a corrected kernel density estimate. It supports various standard bandwidth selection methods.
 Additionally varying rounding probabilities (with the true value) and asymmetric rounding is estimable as well.
