Description: In self-reported or anonymized data the user often encounters heaped data, i.e. data which are rounded (to a possibly different
 degree of coarseness). While this is mostly a minor problem in parametric density estimation the bias can be very large
 for non-parametric methods such as kernel density estimation. This package implements a partly Bayesian algorithm treating the true unknown values as additional
 parameters and estimates the rounding parameters to give a corrected kernel density estimate. It supports various standard bandwidth selection methods. Varying rounding probabilities (depending on the true value) and asymmetric rounding is estimable as well. Additionally, bivariate non-parametric density estimation for rounded data is supported.
