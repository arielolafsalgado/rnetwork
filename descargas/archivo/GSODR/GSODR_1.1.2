Description: Provides automated downloading, parsing, cleaning, unit conversion
    and formatting of Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD) weather data from
    the from the USA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) for
    use in R.  Units are converted from from United States Customary System
    (USCS) units to International System of Units (SI).  Stations may be 
    individually checked for number of missing days defined by the user, where
    stations with too many missing observations are omitted.  Only stations with
    valid reported latitude and longitude values are permitted in the final 
    data.  Additional useful elements, saturation vapour pressure (es), actual 
    vapour pressure (ea) and relative humidity are calculated from the original 
    data and included in the final data set.  The resulting data include station
    identification information, state, country, latitude, longitude, elevation,
    weather observations and associated flags.  Data may be automatically saved 
    to disk. File output may be returned as a comma-separated values (CSV) or
    GeoPackage (GPKG) file.  Additional data are included with this R package: a
    list of elevation values for stations between -60 and 60 degrees latitude 
    derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Measuring Mission (SRTM).  For
    information on the GSOD data from NCEI, please see the GSOD readme.txt file
    available from, <http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/gsod/readme.txt>.
