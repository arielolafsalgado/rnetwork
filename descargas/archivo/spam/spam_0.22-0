Description: Set of function for sparse matrix algebra. Differences
        with SparseM/Matrix are: (1) we only support (essentially) one
        sparse matrix format, (2) based on transparent and simple
        structure(s), (3) tailored for MCMC calculations within GMRF.
        (4) S3 and S4 like-"compatible" ...  and it is fast.
