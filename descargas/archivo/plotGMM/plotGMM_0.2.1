Description: The main function, plot_GMM, is used for plotting output from Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), 
    including both densities and overlaying mixture weight component curves from the fit GMM. The package
    also include the function, plot_cut_point, which plots the cutpoint (mu) from the GMM over a histogram
    of the distribution with several color options. Finally, the package includes the function, plot_mix_comps, 
    which is used in the plot_GMM function, and can be used to create a custom plot for overlaying mixture 
    component curves from GMMs. For the plot_mix_comps function, usage most often will be specifying 
    the "fun" argument within "stat_function" in a ggplot2 object.
