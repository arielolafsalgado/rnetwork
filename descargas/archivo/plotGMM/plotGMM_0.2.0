Description: The main function, plot_GMM, is used for plotting output from Gaussian mixture models, 
    including both densities and overlaying mixture weight component curves from the fit GMM. The 
    package includes another function, plot_mix_comps, which is used in the plot_GMM function, and 
    can be used in any plot generated by the user for overlaying mixture component curves from 
    Gaussian mixture models. For the plot_mix_comps function, usage most often will be specifying 
    the "fun" argument within "stat_function" in a ggplot2 object.
