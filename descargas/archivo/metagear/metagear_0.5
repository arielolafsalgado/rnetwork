Description: Functionalities for facilitating systematic reviews, data
    extractions, and meta-analyses. It includes a GUI (graphical user interface)
    to help screen the abstracts and titles of bibliographic data; tools to assign
    screening effort across multiple collaborators/reviewers and to assess inter-
    reviewer reliability; tools to help automate the download and retrieval of
    journal PDF articles from online databases; figure and image extractions 
    from PDFs; web scraping of citations; automated and manual data extraction 
    from scatter-plot and bar-plot images; PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
    Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow diagrams; simple imputation tools
    to fill gaps in incomplete or missing study parameters; generation of random
    effects sizes for Hedges' d, log response ratio, odds ratio, and correlation
    coefficients for Monte Carlo experiments; covariance equations for modelling
    dependencies among multiple effect sizes (e.g., effect sizes with a common 
    control); and finally summaries that replicate analyses and outputs from 
    widely used but no longer updated meta-analysis software. Funding for this 
    package was supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) grants 
    DBI-1262545 and DEB-1451031.
