Title: Estimation and Inference in Random Attention Models
Description: It is widely documented in psychology, economics and other disciplines that socio-economic agent may not pay full attention to all available alternatives, rendering standard revealed preference theory invalid. This package implements the estimation and inference procedures documented in Cattaneo, Ma, Masatlioglu and Suleymanov (2019) <arXiv:1712.03448>, which utilizes standard choice data to partially identify and estimate a decision maker's preference. For inference, several simulation-based critical values are provided.
