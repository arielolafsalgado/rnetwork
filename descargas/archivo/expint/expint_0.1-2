Description: The exponential integrals E_1(x), E_2(x), E_n(x) and
  Ei(x), and the incomplete gamma function G(a, x) defined for
  negative values of its first argument. The package also gives easy
  access to the underlying C routines through an API; see the package
  vignette for details. A test package included in sub-directory
  example_API provides an implementation. C routines derived from the
  GNU Scientific Library <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>.
