Title: A GUI-Based Program to Compute Probabilities Regarding Group
        Sequential Designs
Version: 1.3.3
Author: Roman Pahl
Description: A graphical user interface to compute group sequential designs
    based on normally distributed test statistics, particularly critical
    boundaries, power, drift, and confidence intervals of such designs. All
    computations are based on the alpha spending approach by Lan-DeMets with
    various alpha spending functions being available to choose among.
