Package: GroupSeq
Title: A GUI-based program to compute probabilities regarding group
        sequential designs.
Version: 1.3.2
Author: Roman Pahl
Description: The package provides a Tcl/Tk-based graphical user interface. It
    enables the construction of group sequential designs based on normally 
    distributed test statistics, and particularly to compute critical 
    boundaries, power, drift, and confidence intervals for such designs. All 
    computations are done via the alpha spending approach by Lan-DeMets. 
    Various alpha spending functions are made available to the user for this
    purpose.
