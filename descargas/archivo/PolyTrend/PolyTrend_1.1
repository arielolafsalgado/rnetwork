Description: This algorithm can classify the trends as linear, quadratic, cubic, concealed or no-trend. The "concealed trend" are those trends that possess quadratic or cubic forms, but the net change between the start and end of the period hasn't been significant. While, the "no-trend" category includes simple linear trends that are below the significant slope coefficient.
