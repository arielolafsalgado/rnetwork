Description: The ANU Quantum Random Number Generator provided by the Australian National University
 generates true random numbers in real-time by measuring the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. This package offers an interface using their API.
 The electromagnetic field of the vacuum exhibits random fluctuations in phase and amplitude at all frequencies.
 By carefully measuring these fluctuations, one is able to generate ultra-high bandwidth random numbers.
 The quantum Random Number Generator is based on the papers by Symul et al., (2011) <doi:10.1063/1.3597793>
 and Haw, et al. (2015) <doi:10.1103/PhysRevApplied.3.054004>.
 The package offers functions to retrieve a sequence of random integers or hexadecimals and true random samples from a normal or uniform distribution.
