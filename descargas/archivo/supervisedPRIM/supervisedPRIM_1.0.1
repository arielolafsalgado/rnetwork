Description: The Patient Rules Induction Method (PRIM) is typically
  used for "bump hunting" data mining to identify regions with abnormally
  high concentrations of data with large or small values. This package
  extends this methodology so that it can be applied to binary classification
  problems and used for prediction.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.1), stats, prim (>= 1.0.16)
