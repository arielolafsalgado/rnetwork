Description: 
    nloptr is an R interface to NLopt. NLopt is a free/open-source library for 
    nonlinear optimization, providing a common interface for a number of 
    different free optimization routines available online as well as original 
    implementations of various other algorithms.
    See http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Introduction for more 
    information on the available algorithms. During installation on Unix the 
    NLopt code is downloaded and compiled from the NLopt website.
