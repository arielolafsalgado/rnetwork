Description: Formula-based user-interfaces to specific transformation models
  implemented in package 'mlt'. Available models include Cox models, some parametric 
  survival models (Weibull, etc.), models for ordered categorical variables,
  normal and non-normal (Box-Cox type) linear models, and continuous outcome logistic regression
  (Lohse et al., 2017, <DOI:10.12688/f1000research.12934.1>). The underlying theory
  is described in Hothorn et al. (2018) <DOI:10.1111/sjos.12291>.
