Description: Advanced response surface analysis. The main function RSA computes
    and compares several nested polynomial regression models (full polynomial,
    shifted and rotated squared differences, rising ridge surfaces, basic
    squared differences). The package provides plotting functions for 3d
    wireframe surfaces, interactive 3d plots, and contour plots. Calculates
    many surface parameters (a1 to a4, principal axes, stationary point,
    eigenvalues) and provides standard, robust, or bootstrapped standard errors
    and confidence intervals for them.
