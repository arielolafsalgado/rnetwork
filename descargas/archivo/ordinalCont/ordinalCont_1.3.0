Description: A regression framework for response variables which are continuous
    self-rating scales such as the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) used in pain
    assessment, or the Linear Analog Self-Assessment (LASA) scales in quality
    of life studies. These scales measure subjects' perception of an intangible
    quantity, and cannot be handled as ratio variables because of their inherent
    non-linearity. We treat them as ordinal variables, measured on a continuous
    scale. A function (the g function) connects the scale with an underlying
    continuous latent variable. The link function is the inverse of the CDF of the
    assumed underlying distribution of the latent variable. Currently the logit
    link, which corresponds to a standard logistic distribution, is implemented.
