Description: Create, manipulate, transform, and simulate from discrete random
    variables. The syntax is modeled after that which is used in mathematical
    statistics and probability courses, but with powerful support more advanced
    probability calculations. This includes the creation of joint random
    variables, and the derivation and manipulation of their conditional and
    marginal distributions.
