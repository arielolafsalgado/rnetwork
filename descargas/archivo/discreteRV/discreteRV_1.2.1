Description: Create, manipulate, transform, and simulate from discrete random
    variables. The syntax is modeled after that which is used in mathematical
    statistics and probability courses, but with powerful support for more
    advanced probability calculations. This includes the creation of joint
    random variables, and the derivation and manipulation of their conditional
    and marginal distributions.
