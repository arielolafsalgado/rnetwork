Description: Multiple functions to compute robust survey statistics. The package 
    supports the computations of robust means, totals, and ratios. Available 
    methods are Huber M-estimators, trimming, and winsorization. The package 
    'robsurvey' complements the 'survey' package. The package additionally 
    includes a weighted version of the resistant line function of base R (line()), 
    as well as two median based simple regression estimators. The methods are 
    described in Hulliger (1995)
