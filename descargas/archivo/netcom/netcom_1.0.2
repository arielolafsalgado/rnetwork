Description: Functions to take two networks stored as matrices and return 
    a node-level injection between them (bijection if the input networks are of the same size). The alignment
    is made by giving the Hungarian algorithm a symmetric cost matrix where entries are the numerical difference in 
    the distributions over time of diffusion within each network originating from each node.
