Description: Provides flexible hazard ratio curves allowing non-linear
        relationships between continuous predictors and survival. To
        better understand the effects that each continuous covariate
        has on the outcome, results are ex pressed in terms of hazard
        ratio curves, taking a specific covariate value as reference.
        Confidence bands for these curves are also derived.
