Description: In Random Forest, prediction has been done for single
  output feature, while linear relation between the
  output features has not been considered in other
  packages. In this package, using linear relation of
  the output features, a multivariate random forest
  prediction has been done, which can predict all the
  output features with one Random forest. If there is
  high correlation among the features, this MRF
  prediction gives better result than the individual
  RFs.
