Description: Analysis of corneal data obtained from a Placido disk corneal 
    topographer with calculation of irregularity indices. A corneal topographer is 
    an ophthalmic clinical device that obtains measurements in the cornea (the anterior 
    part of the eye). A Placido disk corneal topographer makes use of the Placido disk 
    (Rowsey et al. (1981), <doi:10.1001/archopht.1981.03930011093022>, Rand et al.
    (1997), <doi:10.1016/S0886-3350(99)00355-7>), which produce a circular pattern
    of measurement nodes. The raw information measured by such a topographer is 
    used by practitioners to analyze curvatures, to study optical aberrations, or
    to diagnose specific conditions of the eye. The rPACI package allows the 
    calculation of the corneal irregularity indices described in Ramos-Lopez et al.
    (2013), <doi:10.1097/OPX.0b013e3182843f2a>, and that were firstly introduced in
    Ramos-Lopez et al. (2011), <doi:10.1097/OPX.0b013e3182843f2a>. It provides a 
    simple interface to read corneal topography data files as exported by a typical
    Placido disk topographer, to compute the irregularity indices mentioned before,
    and to display summary plots that are easy to interpret for a clinician.
