Description: An implementation of DuMouchel's (1999) 
  <doi:10.1080/00031305.1999.10474456> Bayesian data mining method for the
  market basket problem. Calculates Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM) and
  quantile scores from the posterior distribution using the Gamma-Poisson
  Shrinker (GPS) model to find unusually large cell counts in large, sparse
  contingency tables. Can be used to find unusually high reporting rates of
  adverse events associated with products. In general, can be used to mine any
  database where the co-occurrence of two variables or items is of interest.
  Also calculates relative and proportional reporting ratios. Builds on the work
  of the 'PhViD' package, from which much of the code is derived. Some of the
  added features include stratification to adjust for confounding variables and
  data squashing to improve computational efficiency. Now includes an
  implementation of the EM algorithm for hyperparameter estimation loosely
  derived from the 'mederrRank' package.
