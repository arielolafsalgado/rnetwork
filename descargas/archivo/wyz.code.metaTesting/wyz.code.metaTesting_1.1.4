Description: Test R any R function without having to provide parameter values. 
    Values will be generated, based on semantic naming of parameters as 
    introduced by package 'wyz.code.offensiveProgramming'. Generated tests
    can be saved and reused. Value generation logic can be completed with your
    own specific data types and generation schemes, to meet your requirements.
    Main benefits of 'wyz.code.metaTesting' is higher developer productivity,
    reduced time to production, and industrial inference testing. Refer to 
    chapter 10 of Offensive Programming Book, Fabien GELINEAU (2019, 
    ISBN:979-10-699-4075-8), to learn about details and get value from this 
    package.
