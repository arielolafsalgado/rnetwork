Title: Statistical Analysis of Misreporting on Sensitive Survey
        Questions
Description: Enables investigation of the predictors of misreporting on sensitive survey questions through a multivariate list experiment regression method. The method permits researchers to model whether a survey respondent's answer to the sensitive item in a list experiment is different from his or her answer to an analogous direct question.
