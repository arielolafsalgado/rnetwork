Description: Implementation of multilayered visualizations for enhanced graphical 
    representation of functional analysis data. It combines and integrates omics 
    data derived from expression and functional annotation enrichment analyses. 
    Its plotting functions have been developed with an hierarchical structure in
    mind: starting from a general overview to identify the most enriched
    categories (modified bar plot, bubble plot) to a more detailed one displaying
    different types of relevant information for the molecules in a given set of
    categories (circle plot, chord plot, cluster plot).
Depends: ggplot2, ggdendro, grid, gridExtra, RColorBrewer, R (>= 3.0.3)
