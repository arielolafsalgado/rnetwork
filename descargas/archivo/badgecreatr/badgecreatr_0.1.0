Title: Create Badges for 'Travis', 'Repostatus' 'Codecov.io' Etc in
        Github Readme
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Roel M.", "Hogervorst", email ="hogervorst.rm@gmail.com", role = c("cre", "aut"))
Description: Tired of copy and pasting almost identical markdown for badges in
    every new R package that you create on Github? 
    This package will search your DESCRIPTION file and extract the package name,
    licence, R-version, and current projectversion and transform that into 
    badges. It will also search for a .travis.yml file and create a 'Travis' badge,
    if you use 'Codecov.io' to check your code coverage after a 'Travis' build 
    this package will also build a 'Codecov.io'-badge. All the badges will be 
    placed below the top YAML content of your Rmarkdown file (Readme.Rmd). 
    Currently creates badges for  Projectstatus (Repostatus.org), licence
    travis build status, codecov, minimal R version, CRAN status, 
    current version of your package and last change of Readme.Rmd.
