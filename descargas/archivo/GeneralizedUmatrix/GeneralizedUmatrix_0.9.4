Title: Credible Visualization for Two-Dimensional Projections of Data
Version: 0.9.4
Date: 2017-05-17
Author: Michael Thrun, Alfred Ultsch
Maintainer: Michael Thrun <mthrun@mathematik.uni-marburg.de>
Description: Projections from a high-dimensional data space onto a two-dimensional plane are used to detect structures, such as clusters, in multivariate data. The generalized Umatrix is able to visualize errors of these two-dimensional scatter plots by using a 3D topographic map.
