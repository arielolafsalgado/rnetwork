Description: Assessment of the distributions of baseline continuous and categorical 
    variables in randomised trials. This method is based on the Carlisle-Stouffer 
    method with Monte Carlo simulations. It calculates p-values for each trial 
    baseline variable, as well as combined p-values for each trial - these p-values 
    measure how compatible are distributions of trials baseline variables with 
    random sampling. This package also allows for graphically plotting the 
    cumulative frequencies of computed p-values.
