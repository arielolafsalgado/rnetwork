Description: There are some things that I wish were easier with the 'stringr' 
    or 'stringi' packages. The foremost of these is the extraction of numbers 
    from strings. 'stringr' and 'stringi' make you figure out the regular 
    expression for yourself; 'strex' takes care of this for you. There are many 
    other handy functionalities in 'strex'. Contributions to this package are 
    encouraged: it is intended as a miscellany of string manipulation functions 
    that cannot be found in 'stringi' or 'stringr'.
