Description: Includes functions to work with the Mallows and Generalized Mallows
    Models. The considered distances are Kendall's-tau, Cayley, Hamming and Ulam
    and it includes functions for making inference, sampling and learning such
    distributions, some of which are novel in the literature. As a by-product,
    PerMallows also includes operations for permutations, paying special attention
    to those related with the Kendall's-tau, Cayley, Ulam and Hamming distances. It
    is also possible to generate random permutations at a given distance, or with
    a given number of inversions, or cycles, or fixed points or even with a given
    length on LIS (longest increasing subsequence).
