Description: Includes functions to work with the Mallows and Generalized Mallows Models. The considered distances are Kendall's-tau, Cayley, Hamming and Ulam and it includes functions for making inference, sampling and learning such distributions, some of which are novel in the literature. As a by-product, PerMallows also includes operations for permutations, paying special attention to those related with the Kendall's-tau, Cayley, Ulam and Hamming distances. It is also possible to generate random permutations at a given distance, or with a given number of inversions, or cycles, or fixed points or even with a given length on LIS (longest increasing subsequence).
