Description: Provides methods for estimating borders of uniform distribution on
  the interval (one-dimensional) and on the elliptical domain (two-dimensional)
  under measurement errors. For one-dimensional case, it also estimates the
  length of underlying uniform domain and tests the hypothesized length against
  two-sided or one-sided alternatives. For two-dimensional case, it estimates
  the area of underlying uniform domain. It works with numerical inputs as well
  as with pictures in JPG format.
