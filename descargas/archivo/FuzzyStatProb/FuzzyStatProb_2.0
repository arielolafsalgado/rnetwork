Title: Fuzzy Stationary Probabilities from a Sequence of Observations
        of an Unknown Markov Chain
Type: Package
Description: An implementation of a method for computing fuzzy numbers representing stationary probabilities of an unknown Markov chain,
        from which a sequence of observations along time has been obtained. The algorithm is based on the proposal presented by James Buckley 
        in his book on Fuzzy probabilities (Springer, 2005), chapter 6. Package FuzzyNumbers is used to represent the output probabilities.
