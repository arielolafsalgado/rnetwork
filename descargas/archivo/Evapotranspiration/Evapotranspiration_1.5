Description: Allows the use of user-defined data and constants to calculate potential evapotranspiration (PET i.e. the amount of evaporation from a surface if sufficient water is available) and actual evapotranspiration (AET i.e. the actual amount of water evaporated from a surface) from 17 different formulations including the Penman, Penman-Monteith FAO 56, Priestley-Taylor and Morton formulations.
