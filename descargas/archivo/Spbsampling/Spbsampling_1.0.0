Title: Spatially Balanced Samples
Version: 1.0.0

Description: Provides functions to draw spatially balanced samples. It contains fast implementations (C++ via 'Rcpp') of the included sampling methods. In particular, the algorithms to draw spatially balanced samples are pwd() and swd(). These methods use a probability distribution, proportional to the within sample distance. See Benedetti R and Piersimoni F (2017) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201600194> for details. Moreover, there is a function hpwd(), which is a heuristic method to achieve approximated samples obtained by pwd() in a faster way. See Benedetti R and Piersimoni F (2017) <arXiv:1710.09116> for details. Finally, there are two functions, stprod() and stsum(), useful to standardize distance matrices in order to achieve fixed sample size using, respectively, the functions pwd() and swd().
