Description: The Brazilian Jurimetrics Association (ABJ in
    Portuguese, see <http://www.abjur.org.br/en/> for more information) is
    a non-profit organization which aims to investigate and promote the
    use of statistics and probability in the study of Law and its
    institutions.  This package implements general purpose tools used by
    ABJ, such as functions for sampling and basic manipulation of
    Brazilian lawsuits identification number. It also implements functions
    for text cleaning, such as accentuation removal.
