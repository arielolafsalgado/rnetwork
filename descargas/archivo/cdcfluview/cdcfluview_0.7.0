Description: The 'U.S.' Centers for Disease Control ('CDC') maintains a portal
    <http://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html> for
    accessing state, regional and national influenza statistics as well as
    Mortality Surveillance Data. The web interface makes it difficult and 
    time-consuming to select and retrieve influenza data. Tools are provided 
    to access the data provided by the portal's underlying 'API'.
