Description: Provides core visualisations and summaries for the CRAN package database. The package provides comprehensive methods for cleaning up and organising the information in the CRAN package database, for building package directives networks (depends, imports, suggests, enhances, linking to) and collaboration networks, producing package dependence trees, and for computing useful summaries and producing interactive visualisations from the resulting networks. The package also provides functions to coerce the networks to 'igraph' <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph> objects for further analyses and modelling.
