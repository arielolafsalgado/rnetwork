Title: Centre of mass assessment and consolidation of trees.
Author: Marco Bascietto <marco.bascietto@cnr.it>
Maintainer: Marco Bascietto <marco.bascietto@cnr.it>
Description: The centre of mass is a crucial data for arborists in order to
    consolidate a tree using steel or dynamic cables. Given field-recorded data
    on branchiness of a tree, the package: (i) computes and plots the centre of
    mass of the tree itself, (ii) computes branches slenderness coefficient in
    order to aid the arborist identify potentially dangerous branches, and
    (iii) computes the force acting on a ground plinth and its best position
    relating to the tree centre of mass, should the tree need to be stabilized
    by a steel cable
