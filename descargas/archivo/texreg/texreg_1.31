Description: texreg converts coefficients, standard errors, significance stars, and goodness-of-fit statistics of statistical models into LaTeX tables or HTML tables/MS Word documents or to nicely formatted screen output for the R console for easy model comparison. A list of several models can be combined in a single table. The output is highly customizable. New model types can be easily implemented.
