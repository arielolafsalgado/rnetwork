Description: Estimation and plotting of a function's FANOVA graph to identify the interaction structure and fitting, prediction and simulation of a kriging model modified by the identified structure. The interactive function plotManipulate can only be run on the RStudio IDE with RStudio's package manipulate loaded. RStudio is freely available (www.rstudio.org), and includes package manipulate. The equivalent function plotTk bases on CRAN Repository packages only.
