Description: Fit finite mixtures of Plackett-Luce models for partial top rankings/orderings within the Bayesian framework. It provides MAP point estimates via EM algorithm and posterior MCMC simulations via Gibbs Sampling. It also fits MLE as a special case of the noninformative Bayesian analysis with vague priors. In addition to inferential techniques, the package assists other fundamental phases of a model-based analysis for partial rankings/orderings, by including functions for data manipulation, simulation, descriptive summary, model selection and goodness-of-fit evaluation.
