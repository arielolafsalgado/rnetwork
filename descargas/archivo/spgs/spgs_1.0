Description: A collection of statistical hypothesis tests and other 
	techniques for identifying certain spatial relationships/phenomena in 
	DNA sequences. In particular, it provides tests and graphical methods for determining 
	whether or not DNA sequences comply with Chargaff's second parity rule 
	or exhibit purine-pyrimidine parity. In addition, there are functions for 
	efficiently simulating discrete state space Markov chains and testing 
	arbitrary symbolic sequences of symbols for the presence of first-order 
	Markovianness.
	Also, it has functions for counting words/k-mers (and cylinder patterns) in 
	arbitrary symbolic sequences. Functions which take a DNA sequence as input 
	can handle sequences stored as SeqFastadna objects from the 'seqinr' package.
