Description: Variable transformation and harmonization of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) from
            2001 to 2014. This is useful for researchers interested in using Canadian population health data
            across multiple years as it helps combine variables. This package relies on rec_with_table() which was based off 'sjmisc' rec().
