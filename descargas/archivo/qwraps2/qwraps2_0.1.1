Title: Quick Wraps 2
Version: 0.1.1
Authors@R: person("Peter", "DeWitt", , "dewittpe@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: A collection of (wrapper) functions the creator found useful for 
    quickly placing data summaries and formatted regression results into .Rnw or
    .Rmd files.  Functions for generating commonly used graphics, such as receiver
    operating curves or Bland-Altman plots, are also provided by 'qwraps2'.
    'qwraps2' is a updated version of a package 'qwraps'.  The original version
    'qwraps' was never submitted to CRAN but can be found at
    https://github.com/dewittpe/qwraps.  The implementation and limited scope of the
    functions within 'qwraps2' (https://github.com/dewittpe/qwraps2) is fundamentally
    different from 'qwraps'.
