Description: Compute metrics and indices for climate analysis. The package provides functions to compute extreme indices, evaluate the agreement between models and combine theses models into an ensemble. Multi-model time series of climate indices can be computed either after averaging the 2-D fields from different models provided they share a common grid or by combining time series computed on the model native grid. Indices can be assigned weights and/or combined to construct new indices.
