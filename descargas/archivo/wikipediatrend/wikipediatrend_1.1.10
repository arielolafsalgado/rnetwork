Description: Public attention is an interesting field of study. The
    internet not only allows to access information in no time on
    virtually any subject but via page access statistics gathered
    by website authors the subject of attention as well can be
    studied. For the omnipresent Wikipedia those access statistics
    are made available via 'http://stats.grok.se' a server
    providing the information as file dumps as well as as web API.
    This package provides an easy to use, consistent and traffic
    minimizing approach to make those data accessible within R.
