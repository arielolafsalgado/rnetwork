Description: Extracts meta-features from datasets to support the design of 
  recommendation systems based on Meta-Learning. The meta-features, also 
  called characterization measures, are able to characterize the complexity of 
  datasets and to provide estimates of algorithm performance. The package 
  contains not only the standard characterization measures, but also more 
  recent characterization measures. By making available a large set of 
  meta-feature extraction functions, this package allows a comprehensive data 
  characterization, a deep data exploration and a large number of 
  Meta-Learning based data analysis. These concepts are described in the book:
