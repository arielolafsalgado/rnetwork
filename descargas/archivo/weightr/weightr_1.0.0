Description: Set of functions for estimating the Vevea and Hedges (1995)
    weight-function model in R. By specifying arguments, users can
    also estimate the modified model described in Vevea and Woods (2005), which
    may be more practical with small datasets. Users can also specify moderators
    to estimate a linear model. The package functionality allows users to easily
    extract the results of these analyses as R objects for other uses. In addition,
    the package includes a function to launch both models as a Shiny application.
    Although the Shiny application is also available online, this function allows
    users to launch it locally if they choose.
