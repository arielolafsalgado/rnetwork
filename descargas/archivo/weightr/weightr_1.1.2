Description: Estimates the Vevea and Hedges (1995) <doi:10.1007/BF02294384>
    weight-function model. By specifying arguments, users can
    also estimate the modified model described in Vevea and Woods (2005) 
    <doi:10.1037/1082-989X.10.4.428>, which may be more practical with small datasets. Users 
    can also specify moderators to estimate a linear model. The package functionality 
    allows users to easily extract the results of these analyses as R objects for 
    other uses. In addition, the package includes a function to launch both models as 
    a Shiny application. Although the Shiny application is also available online, 
    this function allows users to launch it locally if they choose.
