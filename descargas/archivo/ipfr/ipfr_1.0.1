Description: Performs iterative proportional updating given a seed table and
  an arbitrary number of marginal distributions. This is commonly used in
  population synthesis, survey raking, matrix rebalancing, and other
  applications. For example, a household survey may be weighted to match the
  known distribution of households by size from the census. An origin/
  destination trip matrix might be balanced to match traffic counts.
  The approach used by this package is based on a paper from
  Arizona State University (Ye, Xin, et. al. (2009)
  <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.537.723&rep=rep1&type=pdf>).
  Some enhancements have been made to their work including primary and 
  secondary target balance/importance, general marginal agreement, and weight 
  restriction.
