Description: Support for measurement units in R vectors; automatic propagation,
    conversion, derivation and simplification of units; raising errors in case
    of unit incompatibility. Compatible with the difftime class. Uses the UNIDATA
    udunits library and unit database for unit conversion and compatibility
    checking.
