Description: Provides tools for simulating from continuous-time individual level models of disease transmission, and carrying out infectious disease data analyses with the same models. The epidemic models considered are distance-based and/or contact network-based models within Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) or Susceptible-Infectious-Notified-Removed (SINR) compartmental frameworks.
