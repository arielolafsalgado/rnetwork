Description: Provides transfusion-related differential tests on Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) time series with detection limit, which contains two testing statistics: Mean Area Under the Curve (MAUC) and slope statistic. This package applied a penalized spline method within an imputation setting. Testing is conducted by a nested permutation approach within imputation.
