Description: Testing for structural change in linear regression relationships.
             It features tests/methods from the generalized fluctuation test
             framework as well as from the F test (Chow test) framework. This
             includes methods to fit, plot and test fluctuation processes (e.g.,
             CUSUM, MOSUM, recursive/moving estimates) and F statistics,
             respectively. Furthermore it is possible to monitor incoming data
             online.
