Description: Standardize the process of bringing various modes of output
    files into R. For more information, see:
    <https://actigraph.desk.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2515800-what-do-the-different-mode-numbers-mean-in-a-csv-or-dat-file->.
    Additionally, processes are provided to read and minimally pre-process
    raw data from primary accelerometer and inertial measurement unit files.
    ActiGraph monitors are used to estimate physical activity outcomes via
    body-worn sensors that measure (e.g.) acceleration or rotational velocity.
