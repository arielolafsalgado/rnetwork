Description: Provides a list of functions for the statistical analysis and the post-processing of the Markov Chains simulated by ChronoModel (see <http://www.chronomodel.fr> for more information).  ChronoModel is a friendly software to construct a chronological model in a Bayesian framework.  Its output is  a sampled Markov chain from the posterior distribution of dates component  the chronology. The functions can also be applied  to the  analyse of mcmc output generated by Oxcal software.
