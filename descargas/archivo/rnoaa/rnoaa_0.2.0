Title: NOAA climate data from R.
Description: This is an R wrapper to many NOAA APIs including the NCDC climate
    API at http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2. There are functions
    for each of the API endpoints: data, data categories, data sets, data
    types, locations, location categories, and stations. In addition, we have
    an interface for NOAA sea ice data that is not part of the climate data
    API, the NOAA severe weather inventory, and ERDDAP data. NOAA buoy data is
    only on the buoy branch in the Github repository for this package (see url
    below).
