Description: The function MC3() searches for log-linear models with the highest posterior probability. The function gibbsSampler() is a blocked Gibbs sampler for sampling from the posterior distribution of the log-linear parameters. The functions findPostMean() and findPostCov() compute the posterior mean and covariance matrix for decomposable models which, for these models, is available in closed form.
