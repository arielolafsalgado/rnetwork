Description: Conducts sensitivity analyses for unmeasured confounding in
    random-effects meta-analysis per Mathur & VanderWeele (in preparation).
    Given output from a random-effects meta-analysis with a relative risk
    outcome, computes point estimates and inference for: (1) the proportion
    of studies with true causal effect sizes more extreme than a specified threshold
    of scientific significance; and (2) the minimum bias factor and confounding
    strength required to reduce to less than a specified threshold the proportion
    of studies with true effect sizes of scientifically significant size.
    Creates plots and tables for visualizing these metrics across a range of bias values.
    Provides tools to easily scrape study-level data from a published forest plot or 
    summary table to obtain the needed estimates when these are not reported.
