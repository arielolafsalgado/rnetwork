Description: Advertisers use a variety of online marketing channels to reach consumers and they want to know the degree each channel contributes to their marketing success. It's called the online multi-channel attribution problem. This package contains a probabilistic algorithm for the attribution problem. The model uses a first-order Markov representation to identifying structural correlations in the customer journey data. The package also contains three heuristic algorithms (first-touch, last-touch and linear-touch approach) for the same problem. The algorithms are implemented in C++. For a more extensive version of the package, which includes a k-order Markov model and useful functions to handle customer journey data, and for customizations please contact <davide.altomare@gmail.com>.
