Title: Evaluation of Model-Data Fit in Item Response Theory (IRT) and
        Useful Functions Related to IRT
Version: 1.0.0
Description: Examine the IRT model-data fit on item-level 
    in different ways as well as provide useful functions related to unidimensional 
    item response theory (IRT). In terms of assessing the IRT model-data fit, one of 
    distinguished features of this package is that it gives not only well-known item 
    fit statistics (e.g., chi-square, infit and oufit statistics 
    (Ames & Penfield (2015) <doi:10.1111/emip.12067>)) but also graphical 
    displays to look at residuals between between the observed data and model-based 
    predictions (Hambleton, Swaminathan, & Rogers (1991, ISBN:9780803936478)). 
    More evaluation methods will be included in the future updated version.  
    In addition to the evaluation of IRT model-data fit, there are several 
    useful functions such as estimating proficiency parameters, calibrating item parameters 
    given the fixed effects (aka. ability values) (Baker & Kim (2004, ISBN:9780824758257)),
    computing asymptotic variance-covariance matrices of item parameter estimates 
    (Li & Lissitz (2004) <doi:10.1111/j.1745-3984.2004.tb01109.x>), importing item and/or 
    ability parameters from popular IRT software, generating simulated data, computing 
    the conditional distribution of observed scores using the Lord-Wingersky recursion 
    formula (Lord & Wingersky (1984) <doi:10.1207/s15324818ame1002_1>), 
    computing item and test information functions, computing item and test 
    characteristic curve functions, and plotting item and test characteristic curves 
    and item and test information functions.
