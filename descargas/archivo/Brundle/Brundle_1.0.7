Title: Normalisation Tools for Inter-Condition Variability of ChIP-Seq
        Data

Description: Inter-sample condition variability is a key challenge of normalising ChIP-seq data. This implementation uses either spike-in or a second factor as a control for normalisation. Input can either be from 'DiffBind' or a matrix formatted for 'DESeq2'. The output is either a 'DiffBind' object or the default 'DESeq2' output. Either can then be processed as normal.
