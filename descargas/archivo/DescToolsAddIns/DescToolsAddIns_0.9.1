Description: 'RStudio' as of recently offers the option to define addins and assign shortcuts to them. This package contains AddIns for a few most used functions in an analysts (at least mine) daily work (like str(), example(), plot(), head(), view(), Desc()). Most of these functions will get the current selection in the editor window and send the specific command to the console while instantly executing it. Assigning shortcuts to these AddIns will spare you quite a few keystrokes.
