Description: Computes functional rarity indices as proposed by Violle et al.
    (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.tree.2017.02.002>. Various indices can be computed
    using both regional and local information. Functional Rarity combines both
    the functional aspect of rarity as well as the extent aspect of rarity.
