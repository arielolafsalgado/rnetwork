Description: Covariance is of universal prevalence across various disciplines within statistics.
    We provide a rich collection of geometric and inferential tools for convenient analysis of
    covariance structures, topics including distance measures, mean covariance estimator,
    covariance hypothesis test for one-sample and two-sample cases, and covariance estimation.
    For an introduction to covariance in multivariate statistical analysis,
    see Schervish (1987) <doi:10.1214/ss/1177013111>.
