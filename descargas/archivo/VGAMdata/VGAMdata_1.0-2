Description: Data sets to accompany the VGAM package and
	the book "Vector Generalized Linear and
	Additive Models: With an Implementation in R" (Yee, 2015)
	<DOI:10.1007/978-1-4939-2818-7>.
	These are used to illustrate vector generalized
	linear and additive models (VGLMs/VGAMs), and associated models
	(Reduced-Rank VGLMs, Quadratic RR-VGLMs, Row-Column
	Interaction Models, and constrained and unconstrained ordination
	models in ecology).
