Description: An implementation of item response theory (IRT) and computer-based testing in R. It is designed for bridging the gap between theoretical advancements in psychometric research and their applications in practice. Currently, it consists of five modules: (1) common IRT functions, (2) estimation procedures, (3) automated test assembly framework, (4) computerized adaptive testing framework, (5) multistage testing framework. See detailed documentation at <https://github.com/xluo11/xxIRT/blob/master/README.md>.
