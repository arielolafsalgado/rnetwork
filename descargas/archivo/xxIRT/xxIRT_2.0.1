Description: An implementation of item response theory and computer-based testing in R. 
    It is designed for bridging the gap between theoretical advancements in 
    psychometric research and their applications in practice. Currently, it 
    consists of five modules: (1) common item response theory functions, (2) estimation procedures, 
    (3) automated test assembly framework, (4) computerized adaptive testing framework, 
    (5) multistage testing framework. See detailed documentation at
