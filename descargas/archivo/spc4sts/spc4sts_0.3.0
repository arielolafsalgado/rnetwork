Description: Provides statistical process control tools for stochastic 
    textured surfaces. The current version supports the following tools: 
    (1) monitors and diagnoses for local defects on stochastic 
        textured surfaces, which was proposed by Bui and Apley (2018a) 
        <doi:10.1080/00401706.2017.1302362>.
    (2) monitors for global changes in the nature of stochastic 
        textured surfaces.
