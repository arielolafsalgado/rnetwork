Description: Various visualizations of high-dimensional data such as heat map and silhouette plot for grouped data, visualizations of the distribution of distances, the scatter-density plot for two variables, the Shepard density plot and many more are presented here. Additionally, 'DataVisualizations' makes it possible to inspect the distribution of each feature of a dataset visually through the combination of four methods. More detailed explanations can be found in the book of Thrun, M.C.:"Projection-Based Clustering through Self-Organization and Swarm Intelligence" (2018) <DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9>.
