Description: Several generalized Fixed Sequence Multiple Testing Procedures (g-
    FSMTPs) are developed for testing a sequence of pre-ordered hypotheses while
    controlling the FWER and FDR. All three FWER controlling g-FSMTPs are designed
    under arbitrary dependence, which allow any number of acceptances, and two
    FDR controlling g-FSMTPs are respectively designed under arbitrary dependence
    and independence, which allow more but a given number of acceptances. The main
    functions for each proposed g-FSMTPs are designed to calculate adjusted p-values
    and critical values, respectively. For users' convenience, the output results
    also include the option of decision rules for convenience.
