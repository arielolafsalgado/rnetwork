Description: Generalized Fixed Sequence Multiple Testing
    Procedures (g-FSMTPs) are used to test a sequence of pre-
    ordered hypotheses. The proposed three Family-wise Error Rate (FWER)
    controlling g-FSMTPs utilize numbers of rejections and acceptances, all
    the procedures are designed under arbitrary dependence. The proposed two False
    Discovery Rate (FDR) controlling g-FSMTPs allows more but a given number of
    acceptances (k>=1), the procedures are designed for arbitrary dependence and
    independence. The main functions for each proposed g-FSMTPs are designed to
    calculate adjusted p-values and critical values, respectively. For users'
    convenience, the output results also include the option of decision rules for
    convenience.
