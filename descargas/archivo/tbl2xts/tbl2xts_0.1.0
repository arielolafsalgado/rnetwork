Title: Convert Tibbles or Data Frames to Xts Easily
Author: Nico Katzke
Description: Facilitate the movement between data frames to 'xts'. Particularly
    useful when moving from 'tidyverse' to the widely used 'xts' package, which is
    the input format of choice to various other packages. It also allows the user 
    to use a 'spread_by' argument for a character column 'xts' conversion.
