Description: The package contains functions to perform various models
        and methods for test equating. It currently implements the
        Kernel Method of Equating using the (traditional) Gaussian
        kernel and also nonstandard alternative kernels such as the
        logistic and uniform. More kernels will be implemented in the
        near future as well as other nonstandard methods of equating.
