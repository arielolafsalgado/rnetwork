Description: Contains functions to perform various models and 
	methods for test equating. It currently implements the traditional 
	mean, linear and equipercentile equating methods, as well as the 
	mean-mean, mean-sigma, Haebara and Stocking-Lord IRT linking methods. 
	It also supports newest methods such that local equating, kernel 
	equating (using Gaussian, logistic and uniform kernels) with presmoothing, 
	and IRT parameter linking methods based on asymmetric item characteristic 
	functions. Functions to obtain both standard error of equating (SEE) 
	and standard error of equating difference between two equating 
	functions (SEED) are also implemented for the kernel method of 
	equating.
