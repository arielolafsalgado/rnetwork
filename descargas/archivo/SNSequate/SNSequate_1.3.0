Description: Contains functions to perform various models and
    methods for test equating. It currently implements the traditional
    mean, linear and equipercentile equating methods, as well as the
    mean-mean, mean-sigma, Haebara and Stocking-Lord IRT linking methods.
    It also supports newest methods such that local equating, kernel
    equating (using Gaussian, logistic and uniform kernels) with presmoothing,
    and IRT parameter linking methods based on asymmetric item characteristic
    functions. Functions to obtain both standard error of equating (SEE)
    and standard error of equating difference between two equating
    functions (SEED) are also implemented for the kernel method of
    equating.
