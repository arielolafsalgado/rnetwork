Description: The target equivalence range (TEQR) design, previously named the toxicity equivalence range design is an up-down design patterned after the modified toxicity probability interval design.The TEQR design extends the well known 3+3 design to allow for: an explicit target range for the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate, more subjects at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and specification of a too-toxic rate, which closes a dose level, In addition, the TEQR design can be implemented to target a dose based either on toxicity rate or activity rate constrained for toxicity.
