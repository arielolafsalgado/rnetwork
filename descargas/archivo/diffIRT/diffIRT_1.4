Description: Package to fit diffusion-based IRT models to response and 
	response time data. Models are fitted using marginal maximum 
	likelihood. Parameter restrictions (fixed value and equality 
	constraints) are possible. In addition, factor scores (person drift 
	rate and person boundary separation) can be estimated. Model fit 
	assessment tools are also available. The traditional diffusion model 
	can be estimated as well.
