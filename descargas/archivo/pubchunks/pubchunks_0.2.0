Title: Fetch Sections of XML Scholarly Articles
Description: Get chunks of XML scholarly articles without 
    having to know how to work with XML. Custom mappers
    for each publisher and for each article section pull 
    out the information you want. Works with outputs from 
    package 'fulltext', 'xml2' package documents, and file paths to 
    XML documents.
