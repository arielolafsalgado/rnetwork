Description: An implementation of the network fingerprint framework. This method 
  worked by making systematic comparisons to a set of well-studied "basic networks",
  measuring both the functional and topological similarity.  A biological could be
  characterized as a spectrum-like vector consisting of similarities to basic 
  networks. It shows great potential in biological network study.
