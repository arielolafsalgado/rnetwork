Title: C++11 Header Files for 'cereal'
Version: 1.2.1

Author: Wush Wu, Randolph Voorhies, and Shane Grant

Description: To facilitate using 'cereal' with Rcpp.
    'cereal' is a header-only C++11 serialization library.
    'cereal' takes arbitrary data types and reversibly turns them into
    different representations, such as compact binary encodings, XML,
    or JSON. 'cereal' was designed to be fast, light-weight, and easy
    to extend - it has no external dependencies and can be easily
    bundled with other code or used standalone. Please see
    <http://uscilab.github.io/cereal> for more information.
