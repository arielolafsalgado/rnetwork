Title: Obtain and Analyze Rainfall Data from the Climate Prediction
        Center
Description: The Climate Prediction Center's (CPC) rainfall data for the
    world (1979 to present, 50 km resolution) and the USA (1948 to
    present, 25 km resolution), is one of the few high quality, long
    term, observation based, daily rainfall products available for free.
    Although raw data is available at CPC's ftp site, obtaining,
    processing and visualizing the data is not straightforward. There are
    more than 12,000 files for the world and about 24,000 files for the USA.
    Moreover, file formats and file extensions have not been consistent.
    This package provides functionality to download, process and visualize
    over 35 years of global rainfall data and over 65 years of USA rainfall
    data from CPC.
