Title: Obtain and Analyze Rainfall Data from the Climate Prediction
        Center
Description: The Climate Prediction Center's (CPC) global rainfall data, 1979
    to present, 0.5 degree (or 50 km) resolution, is one of the few high
    quality, long term, observation based, daily rainfall products available
    for free. Although raw data is available at CPC's ftp site, obtaining,
    processing and visualizing the data is not easy since there are over
    12000 files and formats and names of these files have changed over time.
    This package provides functionality to download, process and visualize over
    35 years of global daily rainfall data from CPC. The vignette demonstrates
    the use of this package, including the extraction and display of regional
    rainfall data.
