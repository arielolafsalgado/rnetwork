Description: An implementation of ADPclust clustering procedures (Fast
    Clustering Using Adaptive Density Peak Detection). The work is built and
    improved upon Rodriguez and Laio[2014]'s idea. ADPclust clusters data by finding
    density peaks in a density-distance plot generated from local multivariate
    Gaussian density estimation. It includes an automatic centroids selection and
    parameter optimization algorithm, which finds the number of clusters and cluster
    centroids by comparing average silhouettes on a grid of testing clustering
    results; It also includes an user interactive algorithm that allows the user
    to manually selects cluster centroids from a two dimensional "density-distance
    plot".
