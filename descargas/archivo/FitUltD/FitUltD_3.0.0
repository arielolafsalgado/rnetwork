Version: 3.0.0

Description: Extends the fitdist() (from 'fitdistrplus') adding the Anderson-Darling ad.test() (from 'ADGofTest') and Kolmogorov Smirnov Test ks.test() inside and trying the distributions (from 'stats') by default and offering a second function which uses mixed distributions to fit, this distributions are split with unsupervised learning, with Mclust() function (from 'mclust').
