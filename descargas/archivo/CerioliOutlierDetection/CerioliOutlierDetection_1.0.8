Description: This package provides the iterated RMCD method of Cerioli (2010)
	for multivariate outlier detection via robust Mahalanobis distances. It also
	provides the finite-sample RMCD method discussed in the paper, as well as 
	the methods provided in Hardin and Rocke (2005) and Green and Martin (2014).
