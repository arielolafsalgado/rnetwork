Description: Add game events to a database file to use for statistical analysis of hockey games. This means we only call the 'NHL' API
    once for each game we want to add. We will have very fast retrieval of data once games have been added since the data is stored locally.
    We use the API located at <https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams> with supplemental data from <https://www.nhl.com/scores/>.
    Other endpoints can be found at <https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi>.
