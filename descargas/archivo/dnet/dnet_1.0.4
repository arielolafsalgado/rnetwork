Description: The 'dnet' package is initiated to fill in the need of an open-source tool for high-throughput omics data in an integrative manner in terms of network, evolution and ontology. More specifically, dnet intends to analyse the biological network whose nodes/genes are associated with digitised information such as expression levels across samples. To help make sense of identified networks, enrichment analysis is also supported using a wide variety of pre-compiled ontologies and phylostratific gene age information in major organisms including human, mouse, rat, chicken, C.elegans, fruit fly, zebrafish and arabidopsis. Add-on functionalities are supports for semantic similarity calculation between ontology terms (and genes), and network affinity calculation using Random Walk with Restart; both can be done via high-performance parallel computing. In summary, dnet aims to deliver an eye-intuitive tool with rich visuals but less inputs.
