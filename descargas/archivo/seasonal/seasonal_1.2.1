    seasonal adjustment software by the US Census Bureau. It offers full
    access to almost all options and outputs of X-13, including X-11 and SEATS,
    automatic ARIMA model search, outlier detection and support for user
    defined holiday variables, such as Chinese New Year or Indian Diwali. It
    also includes a Shiny-based graphical user interface. Seasonal uses the
    X-13 binaries from the 'x13binary' package.
