Description: seasonal is an easy-to-use R-interface to X-13ARIMA-SEATS, the
    newest seasonal adjustment software by the US Census Bureau. It offers full
    access to almost all options and outputs of X-13, including X-11 and SEATS,
    automatic ARIMA model search, outlier detection and support for user
    defined holiday variables, such as Chinese New Year or Indian Diwali. It
    also includes a Shiny-based graphical user interface. Seasonal does not
    contain the binaries of X-13, which must be installed separately. See the
    README file or the vignette for installation notes.
Depends: R (>= 2.15)
Suggests: shiny (>= 0.10)
