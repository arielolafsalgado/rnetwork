Description: Easy-to-use interface to X-13-ARIMA-SEATS, the seasonal adjustment
    software by the US Census Bureau. It offers full access to almost all
    options and outputs of X-13, including X-11 and SEATS, automatic ARIMA model
    search, outlier detection and support for user defined holiday variables,
    such as Chinese New Year or Indian Diwali. A graphical user interface can be
    used through the 'seasonalview' package. Uses the X-13-binaries from the
    'x13binary' package.
Depends: R (>= 2.15)
Imports: x13binary
Suggests: seasonalview (>= 0.1.3)
