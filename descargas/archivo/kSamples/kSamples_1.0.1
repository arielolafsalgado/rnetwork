Description: Compares k samples using the Anderson-Darling test,
        Kruskal-Wallis type tests with different rank score criteria,
        and Steel's multiple comparison test.  It computes asymptotic,
        simulated or (limited) exact P-values, all valid under
        randomization, with or without ties, or conditionally under
        random sampling from populations, given the observed tie
        pattern.  Except for Steel's test it also combines these tests
        across several blocks of samples.  Also analyzed are 2 x t
        contingency tables and their blocked combinations using the
        Kruskal-Wallis criterion.  Steel's test is inverted to provide
        simultaneous confidence bounds for shift parameters.  A
        plotting function shows that asymptotic approximations for
        small sample sizes provide only very limited utility when
        comparing tail probabilities with those obtained via simulation
        or exact calculations.
