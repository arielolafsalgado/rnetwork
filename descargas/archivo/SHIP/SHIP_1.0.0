Description: The SHIP-package allows the estimation of various types of
        shrinkage covariance matrices. These types differ in terms of
        the so-called covariance target (to be chosen by the user), the
        highly structured matrix which the standard unbiased sample
        covariance matrix is shrunken towards and which optionally
        incorporates prior biological knowledge extracted from the
        database KEGG. The shrinkage intensity is obtained via an
        analytical procedure.
