Description: Utility functions for the handling, analysis and visualisation 
  of data from portable emissions measurement systems ('PEMS') and other 
  similar mobile activity monitoring devices. The package includes a dedicated 
  'pems' data class that manages many of the quality control, unit handling 
  and data archiving issues that can hinder efforts to standardise 'PEMS' 
  research.
