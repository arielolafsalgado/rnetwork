Description: A statistically sound method for estimating jointly the attachment function and node fitness in a temporal complex network by maximizing a suitable penalized log-likelihood function is implemented in this package. Tutorial can be found in the accompanying vignette. More details about the method can be found at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0137796.
