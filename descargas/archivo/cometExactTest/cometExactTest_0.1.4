Description: An algorithm for identifying combinations of mutually exclusive alterations in cancer genomes. CoMEt represents the mutations in a set M of k genes with a 2^k dimensional contingency table, and then computes the tail probability of observing T(M) exclusive alterations using an exact statistical test.
