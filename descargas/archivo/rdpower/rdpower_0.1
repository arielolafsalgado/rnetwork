Description: The regression discontinuity (RD) design is a popular quasi-experimental design for causal inference and policy evaluation. The 'rdpower' package provides tools to perform power and sample size calculations in RD designs: rdpower() calculates the power of an RD design and rdsampsi() calculates the required sample size to achieve a desired power. See Cattaneo, Titiunik and Vazquez-Bare (2018) <https://sites.google.com/site/rdpackages/rdpower/Cattaneo-Titiunik-VazquezBare_2018_Stata.pdf> for further methodological details.
