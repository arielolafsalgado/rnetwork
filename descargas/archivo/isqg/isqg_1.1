Description: Accomplish high performance simulations in quantitative genetics. 
    The molecular genetic components are represented by R6/C++ classes and methods. 
    Mimic the meiosis recombination and de novo genetic variability by means a 
    count-location process (Karlin & Liberman, 1978) <doi:10.1073/pnas.75.12.6332>. 
    The core computational algorithm is implemented using 'Boost' dynamic bitsets 
    (Schaling, 2014) [ISBN:978-1937434366]. A mix between low and high level interfaces 
    provides great flexibility and allows user defined extensions and a wide range of 
    applications.
