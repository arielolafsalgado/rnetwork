Description: Applies local log-linear capture-recapture models (LLLMs) a for
    closed populations, as described in the ongoing doctoral thesis work of
    Zachary Kurtz in the department of statistics at Carnegie Mellon
    University.  The method is relevant when there are 3-4 capture occasions,
    with auxiliary covariates available for all capture occasions.  As part of
    estimating the number of missing population units, the method estimates the
    "rate of missingness" as it varies over the covariate space.  In addition,
    user-friendly functions are provided to recreate (approximately) the method
    of Zwane and Van der Heijden (2004), which applied the VGAM package in a
    way that is closely related to LLLMs.
