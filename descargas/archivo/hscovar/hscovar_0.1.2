Description: The theoretical covariance between pairs of markers is calculated
    from either paternal haplotypes and maternal linkage disequilibrium (LD) or 
    vise versa. A genetic map is required. Grouping of markers is based on the 
    correlation matrix and a representative marker is suggested for each group.
    The implementation relies on paternal half-sib families and biallelic 
    markers. If maternal half-sib families are used, the roles of sire/dam are 
    swapped. Multiple families can be considered.
