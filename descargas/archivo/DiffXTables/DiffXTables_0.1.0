Description: Statistical hypothesis testing of pattern heterogeneity via
    differences in underlying distributions across two or more contingency
    tables. Three tests are included: the comparative chi-squared test
    (Song et al, 2014) <doi:10.1093/nar/gku086> (Zhang et al, 2015)
    <doi:10.1093/nar/gkv358>, the Sharma-Song test, and the heterogeneity test.
    Under the null hypothesis that row and column variables are statistically
    independent and joint distributions are equal, their test statistics all
    follow an asymptotically chi-squared distribution. These options test for
    heterogeneous patterns that differ in either the first order (marginal) or
    the second order (joint distribution deviation from product of marginals).
    Second-order differences may reveal more fundamental changes than
    first-order differences across heterogeneous patterns.
