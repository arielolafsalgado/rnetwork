Description: Statistical methods for hypothesis testing of differences in the
    underlying distributions across two or more contingency tables. The package
    includes three tests: the comparative chi-squared test (Song et al, 2014)
    <doi:10.1093/nar/gku086> (Zhang et al, 2015) <doi:10.1093/nar/gkv358>, the
    Sharma-Song test, and the heterogeneity test. They all have an
    asymptotically chi-squared null distribution. These options allow one to
    test for patterns that differ in first and second orders, directly related
    to marginal and joint distributions of given contingency tables.
