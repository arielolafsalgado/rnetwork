Description: Fast, lightweight toolkit for data splitting. Data
    sets can be partitioned into disjoint groups (e.g. into training,
    validation, and test) or into (repeated) k-folds for subsequent
    cross-validation. Besides basic splits, the package supports
    stratified, grouped as well as blocked splitting. Furthermore,
    cross-validation folds for time series data can be created. See e.g.
    Hastie et al. (2001) <doi:10.1007/978-0-387-84858-7> for the basic
    background on data partitioning and cross-validation.
