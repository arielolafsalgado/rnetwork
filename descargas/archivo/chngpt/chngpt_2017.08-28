Description: Change point regression models are also called two-phase regression, break-point regression, split-point regression, structural change models and threshold regression models. Hypothesis testing in change point logistic regression with or without interaction terms (Fong, Y., Di, C., Perma, S. (2014) <doi:10.1002/sim.6419>). Several options are provided for testing in models with interaction, including a maximum of likelihood ratios test that determines p-value through Monte Carlo. Estimation under change point model is also included with model-robust confidence intervals for continuous threshold regression models (Fong, Y., Di, C., Huang, Y., Gilbert, P. (2017) <doi:10.1111/biom.12623>).
