Description: Builds regression trees and random forests for longitudinal or functional data using a spline projection method. Implements and extends the work of Yu and Lambert (1999) <doi:10.1080/10618600.1999.10474847>. This method allows trees and forests to be built while considering either level and shape or only shape of response trajectories.
