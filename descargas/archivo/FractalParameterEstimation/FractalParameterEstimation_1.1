Description: The parameters p and q are estimated with the aid of a randomized Sierpinski Carpet which is built on a [p-p-p-q]-model. Thereby, for three times a simulation with a p-value and once with a q-value is assumed. Hence, these parameters are estimated and displayed. Moreover, a function for simulating random Sierpinski-Carpets is included.
