Description: Provides two main functionalities.
    1 - Given a system of simultaneous equation,
    it decomposes  the matrix of coefficients weighting the endogenous variables 
    into three submatrices: one includes the subset of coefficients that have a causal nature
    in the model, two include the subset of coefficients that have a interdependent nature
    in the model, either at systematic level or induced by the correlation between error terms.
    2 - Given a decomposed model,
    it tests for the significance of the interdependent relationships acting in the system, 
    via Maximum likelihood and Wald test, which can be built starting from the function output.
