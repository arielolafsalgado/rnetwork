Description: Simultaneous clustering of rows and columns, usually designated by
    biclustering, co-clustering or block clustering, is an important technique
    in two way data analysis. It consists of estimating a mixture model which
    takes into account the block clustering problem on both the individual and
    variables sets. The blockcluster package provides a bridge between the C++
    core library and the R statistical computing environment. This package
    allows to co-cluster binary, contingency, continuous and categorical
    data-sets. It also provides utility functions to visualize the results.
    This package may be useful for various applications in fields of Data
    mining,Information retrieval, Biology, computer vision and many more. More
