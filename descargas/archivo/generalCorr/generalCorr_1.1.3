Description: Since causal paths from data are important for all sciences, the
    package provides many sophisticated functions. causeSummary()
    gives easy-to-interpret causal paths.  Let Z denote control variables and compare 
    two flipped kernel regressions: X=f(Y, Z)+e1 and Y=g(X,Z)+e2. Our criterion Cr1 
    says that if |e1*Y|>|e2*X| then variation in X is more "exogenous or independent"
    than in Y and causal path is X to Y. Criterion Cr2 requires |e2|<|e1|. These
    inequalities between many absolute value are quantified by four orders of 
    stochastic dominance. Our third criterion Cr3 for the causal path X to Y
    requires new generalized partial correlations to satisfy |r*(x|y,z)|< |r*(y|x,z)|.
    The function parcorMany() reports generalized partials between the first
    variable and all others.  The package provides additional R tools for 
    causal assessment, "outlier detection," and for numerical integration by the
    trapezoidal rule, stochastic dominance, pillar 3D charts, etc. We also provide
    functions for bootstrap-based statistical inference for causal paths.
