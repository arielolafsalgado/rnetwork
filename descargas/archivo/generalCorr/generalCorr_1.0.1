Description: Asymmetric generalized correlations r*(x|y) measure strength of the
    dependence of x on y. If |r*(x|y)|> |r*(y|x)| it suggests that y is more likely
    the "kernel cause" of x. There are at least two additional ways of comparing
    two kernel regressions helping identify the `cause'. 
    In simultaneous equation
    models where endogeneity of regressors is feared, we can use Prof. Koopmans' method
    to ignore endogeneity problems when it kernel causes the dependent variable. 
    The usual partial correlations can be generalized for the asymmetric matrix of r*'s.
    Partial correlations help asses effect of x on y after removing the effect of a
    set of variables. 
    The package provides additional tools for causal assessment,
    for printing the causal detections in a clear, comprehensive compact summary form,
    for matrix algebra, for outlier detection, and for numerical integration by the
    trapezoidal rule, stochastic dominance, etc. 
    The package has a function for bootstrap-based statistical inference and one 
    for a heuristic t-test.
