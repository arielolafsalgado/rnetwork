Description: A fold change rank based method is presented to search for genes with changing
             expression and to detect recurrent chromosomal copy number aberrations. This 
             method may be useful for high-throughput biological data (micro-array, sequencing, ...).
             Probabilities are associated with genes or probes in the data set and there is no
             problem of multiple tests when using this method. For array-based comparative genomic
             hybridization data, segmentation results are obtained by merging the significant
             probes detected.
