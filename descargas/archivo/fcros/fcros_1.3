Description: A fold change rank ordering statistics method is presented to search for 
   differentially expressed genes and to detect recurrent chromosomal copy number aberrations.
   This method may be useful for high-throughput biological data (microarray, sequencing, ...).
   Probabilities are associated with genes in the dataset and there is no problem of multiple 
   tests when using this method.
