Description: Provides a sparse matrix format with data stored on disk, to be
    used in both R and C++. This is intended for more efficient use of sparse 
    data in C++ and also when parallelizing, since data on disk does not need
    copying. Only a limited number of features will be implemented. For now,
    conversion can be performed from a 'dgCMatrix' of R package 'Matrix'.
