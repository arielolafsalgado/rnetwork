Description: Shiny Dexter provides a graphic user interface to most of the main functionality in dexter. 
  Its main purpose is to make the first steps in R for the practising psychometrician much easier but it can be used
  as a standalone tool for the main psychometric tasks of a typical educational testing institute such as Data management,
  Classical test analysis and IRT.
