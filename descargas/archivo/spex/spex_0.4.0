Title: Spatial Extent as Polygons with Projection
Version: 0.4.0
Authors@R: person("Michael D.","Sumner", role = c("aut", "cre"), email =
    "mdsumner@gmail.com")
Description: Functions to produce a fully fledged 'geo-spatial' object extent as a
    'SpatialPolygonsDataFrame'. Also included are functions to generate polygons
    from raster data using 'quadmesh' techniques, a round number buffered extent, and
    general spatial-extent and 'raster-like' extent helpers missing from the originating
    packages.
