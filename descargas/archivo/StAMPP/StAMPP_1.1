Description: StAMPP allows users to calculate pairwise Nei's Genetic
        Distances (Nei 1972), pairwise Fixation Indexes (Fst) (Weir &
        Cockerham 1984) and also Genomic Relationship matrixes
        following Yang et al. (2010) in mixed and single ploidy
        populations. Bootstrapping across loci is implemented during
        Fst calculation to generate confidence intervals and p-values
        around pairwise Fst values. StAMPP utilises SNP genotype data
        of any ploidy level (with the ability to handle missing data)
        and is coded to utilise multithreading where available to allow
        efficient analysis of large datasets. StAMPP is able to handle
        genotype data from genlight objects allowing integration with
        other packages such adegenet.  Please refer to LW Pembleton,
