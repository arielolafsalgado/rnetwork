Description: A modified SPRT (MSPRT) can be designed and implemented with the help of this package. In a
             MSPRT design, the maximum sample size of an experiment is fixed prior to the start of an
             experiment, the alternative hypothesis used to define the rejection region of the test is
             derived from the size of the test (Type I error), the maximum available sample size (N), and
             the targeted Type 2 error (equal to 1 minus the power) is also prespecified. Given these values,
             the MSPRT is defined in a manner very similar to Wald's initial proposal. This test can reduce
             the average sample size required to perform statistical hypothesis tests at the specified levels
             of significance and power. This package facilitates the carrying out of one sample Z tests, T Tests
             and tests of binomial success probabilities. A user guidance for this software package is provided
             here and also in the supplemental information.
