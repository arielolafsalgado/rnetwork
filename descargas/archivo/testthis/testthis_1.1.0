Description: 
  Utility functions and 'RStudio' addins for writing, running and organizing 
  automated tests. Integrates tightly with the packages 'testthat', 'devtools' 
  and 'usethis'.
  Hotkeys can be assigned to the 'RStudio' addins for running tests in a single
  file or to switch between a source file and the associated test file. In
  addition, testthis provides function to manage and run tests in 
  subdirectories of the test/testthat directory.
