Title: Epilepsy Ontology Similarities
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Bernd MÃ¼ller
Maintainer: Bernd Mueller <bernd.mueller@zbmed.de>
Depends: R (>= 2.10)
Description: Analysis and visualization of similarities between epilepsy ontologies based on text mining results by comparing ranked lists of co-occurring drug terms in the corpus of LIVIVO. The ranked result lists of neurological drug terms co-occurring with named entities from the epilepsy ontologies EpSO, ESSO, and EPILONT are aggregated in order to generate two different results: an overview table of drugs that are relevant to epilepsy created with the method createNeuroTable, and a plot of tanimoto similarity coefficients between the aggregated list of drug terms against the list of drug terms from each of the ontologies created with the method createTanimotoBaseline(). The alignment of the Top-K Ranked Lists is conducted using the R-package TopKLists <https://cran.r-project.org/package=TopKLists>. The source data to create the ranked lists of drug names is produced using the text mining workflows described in Mueller, Bernd and Hagelstein, Alexandra (2016) <doi:10.4126/FRL01-006408558> and Mueller, Bernd et al. (2017) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-58694-6_22>.
