Title: A SINful Approach to Selection of Gaussian Graphical Markov
        Models

Description: This package provides routines to perform SIN model
        selection as described in Drton & Perlman (2004, 2008).  The
        selected models are represented in the format of the 'ggm'
        package, which allows in particular parameter estimation in the
        selected model.
