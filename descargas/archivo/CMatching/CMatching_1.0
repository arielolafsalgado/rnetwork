Description: Provides functions to perform matching algorithms for causal inference with clustered data, as described in B. Arpino and M. Cannas (2016) <doi:10.1002/sim.6880>. Pure within-cluster and preferential-within cluster matching are implemented. Both algorithms provide causal estimates with cluster-adjusted estimates of standard errors.
