Description: Implements several string comparison algorithms, including calACS
    (count all common subsequences), lenACS (calculate the lengths of all common subsequences), and lenLCS
    (calculate the length of the longest common subsequence).
    Some algorithms differentiate between the more strict
    definition of subsequence, where a common subsequence cannot be separated
    by any other items, from its looser counterpart, where a common subsequence
    can be interrupted by other items. This difference is shown in the suffix of the algorithm (-Strict vs -Loose).
    For example, q-w is a common subsequence
    of q-w-e-r and q-e-w-r on the looser definition, but not on the more strict
    definition. calACSLoose Algorithm from Wang, H. All common subsequences
