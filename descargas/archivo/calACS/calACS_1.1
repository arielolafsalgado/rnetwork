Description: Count all common subsequences between 2 string sequences, with
    items separated by the same delimiter. The first string input is a length-
    one vector, the second string input can be a vector or list containing
    multiple strings. The algorithm differentiates between the more strict
    definition of subsequence, where a common subsequence cannot be separated
    by any other items, from its looser counterpart, where a common subsequence
    can be interrupted by other items. For example, q-w is a common subsequence
    of q-w-e-r and q-e-w-r on the looser definition, but not the more strict
    definition. calACSLoose Algorithm from Wang, H. All common subsequences
