Title: Pharmacokinetics in R
Description: Conduct a noncompartmental analysis as closely as possible to the most widely used commercial software for pharmacokinetic analysis, i.e. 'Phoenix(R) WinNonlin(R)' <https://www.certara.com/software/pkpd-modeling-and-simulation/phoenix-winnonlin/>.
             Some features are
             1) CDISC SDTM terms
             2) Automatic slope selection with the same criterion of WinNonlin(R)
             3) Supporting both 'linear-up linear-down' and 'linear-up log-down' method
             4) Interval(partial) AUCs with 'linear' or 'log' interpolation method
