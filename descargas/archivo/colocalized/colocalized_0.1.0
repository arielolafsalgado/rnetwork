Title: Clusters of Colocalized Sequences
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Stefan", "Golas", email = "stefanmgolas@gmail.com", role = c("cre","aut"))
Description: Finds clusters of colocalized sequences in .bed annotation files
    up to a specified cut-off distance. Two sequences are colocalized if they
    are within the cut-off distance of each other, and clusters are sets of
    sequences where each sequence is colocalized to at least one other sequence
    in the cluster. For a set of .bed annotation tables provided in a list 
    along with a cut-off distance, the program will output a file containing
    the locations of each cluster. Annotated .bed files are from 
    the 'pwmscan' application at <https://ccg.epfl.ch/pwmtools/pwmscan.php>. 
    Personal machines might crash or take excessively long depending 
    on the number of annotated sequences in each file and whether chromsearch() 
    or gensearch() is used.
