Title: Interim Monitoring Using Adaptively Weighted Log-Rank Test in
        Clinical Trials
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Daewoo Pak and Song Yang

Description: Provide monitoring boundaries for interim testing using the 
    adaptively weighted log-rank test developed by 
    Yang and Prentice (2010 <doi:10.1111/j.1541-0420.2009.01243.x>). 
    The package use a re-sampling method to obtain stopping boundaries
    in sequential designs. The output consists of stopping boundaries at
    the interim looks along with nominal p-values defined as the 
    probability of the test exceeding the specific observed value or 
    critical value, regardless of the test behavior at other looks.
    The asymptotic distribution of the test statistics of the adaptively
    weighted log-rank test at the interim looks is examined in
    Yang (2017, pre-print).
