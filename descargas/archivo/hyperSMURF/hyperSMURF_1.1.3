Description: Machine learning supervised method to learn rare genomic features in imbalanced genetic data sets. This method can be also applied to classify or rank examples characterized by a high imbalance between the minority and majority class. hyperSMURF adopts a hyper-ensemble (ensemble of ensembles) approach, undersampling of the majority class and oversampling of the minority class to learn highly imbalanced data. Both single-core and parallel multi-core version of hyperSMURF are implemented.
