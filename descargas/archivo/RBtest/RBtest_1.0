Title: Regression-Based Approach for Testing the Type of Missing Data
Version: 1.0
Author: Serguei Rouzinov and Andr√© Berchtold

Description: The regression-based (RB) approach is a method to test the missing data mechanism.
			This package contains two functions that test the type of missing data (Missing Completely 
			At Random vs Missing At Random) on the basis of the RB approach. The first function applies 
			the RB approach independently on each variable with missing data, using the completely 
			observed variables only. The second function tests the missing data mechanism globally 
			(on all variables with missing data) with the use of all available information. The 
			algorithm is adapted both to continuous and categorical data.
