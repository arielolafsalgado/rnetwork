Description: Implements diversity forests as described in an
  upcoming paper by the author of the package.
  This package is a fork of the R package 'ranger' (main author: 
  Marvin N. Wright) that implements random forests using an efficient C++ 
  implementation. More precisely, 'diversityForest' was written by modifying 
  the code of 'ranger', version 0.11.0. Therefore, details on further 
  functionalities of the code that are not presented in the help pages of 
  'diversityForest' are found in the help pages of 'ranger' (version 0.11.0). 
  The code in the example sections of the 'diversityForest' manual can be used 
  as a template for all basic application scenarios with respect to 
  classification using univariate, binary splitting. Some function 
  arguments adopted from the 'ranger' package are not be useable
  with diversity forests (for the current package version).
