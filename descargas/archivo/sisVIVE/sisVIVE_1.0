Description: Selects invalid instruments amongst a candidate of potentially bad instruments. The algorithm selects potentially invalid instruments and provides an estimate of the causal effect between exposure and outcome. The paper, Instrumental Variables Estimation with Some Invalid Instruments and its Application to Mendelian Randomization by Hyunseung Kang, Anru Zhang, T. Tony Cai, and Dylan S. Small (on arXiv) has more details on this procedure.
