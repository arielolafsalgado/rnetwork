Description: Efficient approximate leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO)
    using Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for
    regularizing importance weights. As a byproduct of the calculations, we also
    obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors, and for
    the comparison of predictive errors between models. We also compute the
    widely applicable information criterion (WAIC).
