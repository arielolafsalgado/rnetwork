Description: Set of functions to keep track of user-defined
    environment names which cannot be retrieved with the built-in function environmentName.
    The main function in this package for this purpose has a similar name: environment_name(),
    which returns the name of the environment given as parameter, be it a system, package,
    user-defined, or function execution environment.  
    The package also provides additional functionality, the most important ones being:  
    - A function (obj_find()) to search for objects. This function extends the functionality of exists()
    as follows: objects are searched recursively within all user-defined environments.  
    - A way to get the stack of calling function names (get_fun_calling_chain()),
    in an easier way than the built-in function sys.call(), which requires further
    non-intuitive parsing of the output.  
    - A function (get_obj_address()) to retrieve the memory address of an object.
    This package was inspired by an "R for developers" course given by Andrea Spano from Quantide
    (<http://www.quantide.com/courses-overview/r-for-developers>)
    and by a post by Gabor Grothendieck at the R-Help forum
    (<https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2010-July/245646.html>).
