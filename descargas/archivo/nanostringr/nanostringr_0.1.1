Description: Provides quality control (QC), normalization, and
    batch effect correction operations for 'NanoString nCounter' data,
    Talhouk et al. (2016) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0153844>.  Various
    metrics are used to determine which samples passed or failed QC.  Gene
    expression should first be normalized to housekeeping genes, before a
    reference-based approach is used to adjust for batch effects.  Raw
    NanoString data can be imported in the form of Reporter Code Count
    (RCC) files.
