Description: It computes the raw moments for the folded and truncated multivariate normal and Student's t-distribution. It also offers specific functions to compute the mean and variance-covariance matrix as well as the cumulative distribution function (cdf) for the folded normal and folded t-distribution. Algorithms are extensions based on Kan, R., & Robotti, C. (2017) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1322092>.
