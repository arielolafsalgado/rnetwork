Title: analysis of complex survey samples
Description: Summary statistics, generalised linear models, Cox models,
        loglinear models, and general maximum pseudolikelihood
        estimation for multistage stratified, cluster-sampled,
        unequally weighted survey samples. Variances by Taylor series
        linearisation or replicate weights. Post-stratification,
        calibration, and raking. Two-phase designs. Graphics.
        Predictive margins by direct standardization.
