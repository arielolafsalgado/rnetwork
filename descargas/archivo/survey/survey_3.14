Title: analysis of complex survey samples
Description: Summary statistics, generalised linear models, Cox models,

        estimation for multistage stratified, cluster-sampled,
        unequally weighted survey samples. Variances by Taylor series
        linearisation or replicate weights. Post-stratification,
        calibration, and raking. Two-phase designs. Graphics.
