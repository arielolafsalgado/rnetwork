Title: analysis of complex survey samples
Description: Summary statistics, generalised linear models, cumulative
        link models, Cox models, loglinear models, and general maximum
        pseudolikelihood estimation for multistage stratified,
        cluster-sampled, unequally weighted survey samples. Variances
        by Taylor series linearisation or replicate weights.
        Post-stratification, calibration, and raking. Two-phase
        subsampling designs. Graphics. Predictive margins by direct
        standardization. PPS sampling without replacement. Principal
        components, factor analysis.
