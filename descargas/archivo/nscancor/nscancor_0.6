Title: Non-Negative and Sparse CCA
Description: This package implements two algorithms for canonical correlation
    analysis (CCA) that are based on iterated regression
    steps. By choosing the appropriate regression algorithm for each data
    modality, it is possible to enforce sparsity, non-negativity or other kinds
    of constraints on the projection vectors. Multiple canonical variables are
    computed sequentially using a generalized deflation scheme, where the
    additional correlation not explained by previous variables is maximized.
    'nscancor' is used to analyze paired data from two domains, and has the same
    interface as the 'cancor' function from the 'stats' package (plus some extra
    parameters). 'mcancor' is appropriate for analyzing data from three or more
    domains.
