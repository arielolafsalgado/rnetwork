Description: Classification performance metrics that are derived from the ROC
    curve of a classifier. The package includes the H-measure performance metric
    as described in <http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-009-5119-5>,
    which computes the minimum total misclassification cost, integrating over any
    uncertainty about the relative misclassification costs, as per a user-defined
    prior. It also offers a one-stop-shop for other scalar metrics of performance,
    including sensitivity, specificity and many others, and also offers plotting
    tools for ROC curves and related statistics.
