Title: Data Exchange Between R and LabKey Server
Author: Peter Hussey 
Maintainer: Cory Nathe <cnathe@labkey.com>
Description: The LabKey client library for R makes it easy for R users to
    load live data from a LabKey Server, <http://www.labkey.com/>,
    into the R environment for analysis, provided users have permissions
    to read the data. It also enables R users to insert, update, and
    delete records stored on a LabKey Server, provided they have appropriate
    permissions to do so.
