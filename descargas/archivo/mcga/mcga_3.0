Description: Machine coded genetic algorithm (MCGA) is a fast tool for
    real-valued optimization problems. It uses the byte
    representation of variables rather than real-values. It
    performs the classical crossover operations (uniform) on these
    byte representations. Mutation operator is also similar to
    classical mutation operator, which is to say, it changes a
    randomly selected byte value of a chromosome by +1 or -1 with
    probability 1/2. In MCGAs there is no need for
    encoding-decoding process and the classical operators are
    directly applicable on real-values. It is fast and can handle a
    wide range of a search space with high precision. Using a
    256-unary alphabet is the main disadvantage of this algorithm
    but a moderate size population is convenient for many problems.
    Package also includes multi_mcga function for multi objective
    optimization problems. This function sorts the chromosomes
    using their ranks calculated from the non-dominated sorting
    algorithm.
