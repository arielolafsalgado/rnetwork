Description: Using overlap grouped lasso penalties, gamsel selects whether a term in a gam is nonzero, linear, or a non-linear spline (up to a specified max df per variable). It fits the entire regularization path on a grid of values for the overall penalty lambda, both for gaussian and binomial families.
