Title: Simulation of Pleiotropic, Linked and Epistatic Phenotypes
Description: The number of studies involving correlated traits and the availability of tools to handle this type of data has increased considerably in the last decade. With such a demand, we need tools for testing hypotheses related to single and multi-trait (correlated) phenotypes based on many genetic settings. Thus, we implemented various options for simulation of pleiotropy and Linkage Disequilibrium under additive, dominance and epistatic models. The simulation currently takes a HapMap file as an input and numericalize it with GAPIT.numericalization Lipka et al. (2012) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bts444>. The numericalized dataset is then used by a framework adapted from Rice and Lipka (2019) <doi:10.3835/plantgenome2018.07.0052> for simulating multiple traits.
