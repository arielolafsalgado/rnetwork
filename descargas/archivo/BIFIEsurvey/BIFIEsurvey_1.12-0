Description: 
    Contains tools for survey statistics (especially in educational
    assessment) for datasets with replication designs (jackknife, 
    bootstrap, replicate weights). Descriptive statistics, linear
    and logistic regression, path models for manifest variables
    with measurement error correction and two-level hierarchical
    regressions for weighted samples are included. Statistical 
    inference can be conducted for multiply imputed datasets and
    nested multiply imputed datasets.
