Description: Dynamic interaction refers to spatial-temporal associations in the
    movements of two (or more) animals. This package provides tools for
    calculating a suite of indices used for quantifying dynamic interaction
    with wildlife telemetry data. For more information on each of the methods
    employed see the references within. The package draws heavily on the
    classes and methods developed in the 'adehabitat' packages.
