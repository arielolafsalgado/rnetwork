Description: It provides a novel variable selection approach in the 
      multivariate framework of the general linear model taking into account the dependence 
      that may exist between the columns of the observations matrix. For further details we
      refer the reader to the paper Perrot-Dockes et al. (2017), <arXiv:1704.00076>.
