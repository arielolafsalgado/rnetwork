Description: Generates and evaluates D, I, A, Alias, E, T, and G optimal designs. Supports generation and evaluation of split/split-split/.../N-split plot designs. Includes parametric and Monte Carlo power evaluation functions, and supports calculating power for censored responses. Provides a framework to evaluate power using functions provided in other packages or written by the user. Includes a Shiny graphical user interface that displays the underlying code used to create and evaluate the design to improve ease-of-use and make analyses more reproducible.
