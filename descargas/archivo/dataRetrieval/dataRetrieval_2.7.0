Description: Collection of functions to help retrieve U.S. Geological Survey
    (USGS) and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) water quality and
    hydrology data from web services. USGS web services are discovered from 
    National Water Information System (NWIS) <https://waterservices.usgs.gov/> and <https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis>. 
    Both EPA and USGS water quality data are obtained from the Water Quality Portal <https://www.waterqualitydata.us/>.
