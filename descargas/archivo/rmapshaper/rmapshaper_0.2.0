Description: Edit and simplify 'geojson' and 'Spatial' objects.
    This is wrapper around the 'mapshaper' 'javascript' library
    <https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper/> to perform topologically-aware
    polygon simplification, as well as other operations such as clipping,
    erasing, dissolving, and converting 'multi-part' to 'single-part' geometries.
    It relies on the 'geojsonio' package for working with 'geojson' objects,
    and the 'sp' and 'rgdal' packages for working with 'Spatial' objects.
