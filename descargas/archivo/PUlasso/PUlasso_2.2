Description: Efficient algorithm for solving PU (Positive and Unlabelled) problem in low or high dimensional setting with lasso or group lasso penalty. The algorithm uses Maximization-Minorization and (block) coordinate descent. Sparse calculation and parallel computing via 'OpenMP' are supported for the computational speed-up. See Hyebin Song, Garvesh Raskutti (2017) <arXiv:1711.08129>.
