Description: Statistical tests widely utilized in biostatistics, public policy, and law. Along with the well-known tests for equality of means and variances, randomness, 
 measures of relative variability etc, the package contains new robust tests of symmetry, 
 omnibus and directional tests of normality, and their graphical counterparts such as 
 Robust QQ plot; a robust trend tests for variances etc. All implemented tests and methods 
 are illustrated by simulations and real-life examples from legal statistics, economics, 
 and biostatistics.
