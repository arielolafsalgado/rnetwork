Description: Implementation of several MCDM methods for fuzzy data (triangular
    fuzzy numbers) for decision making problems. The methods that are implemented in
    this package are Fuzzy TOPSIS (with two normalization procedures), Fuzzy VIKOR,
    Fuzzy Multi-MOORA and Fuzzy WASPAS. In addition, function MetaRanking() calculates
    a new ranking from the sum of the rankings calculated, as well as an aggregated ranking.
