Description: Fits Gaussian mixtures by applying evolution. As fitness function a mixture of the chi square test for distributions and a novel measure for approximating the common area under curves between multiple Gaussians is used. The package presents an alternative to the commonly used likelihood maximisation as is used in Expectation maximisation. The evolution is based on the 'GA' package: Luca Scrucca (2013) <doi:10.18637/jss.v053.i04> while the Gaussian Mixture Logic stems from 'AdaptGauss': Alfred Ultsch, Michael Thrun, Onno Hansen-Goos, Jorn Lotsch (2015) <doi:10.3390/ijms161025897>.
