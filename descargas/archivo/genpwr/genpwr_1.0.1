Description: Power and sample size calculations for genetic association studies allowing 
    for misspecification of the model of genetic susceptibility.
    Power and/or sample size can be calculated for logistic (case/control study design) 
    and linear (continuous phenotype) regression models, using additive, dominant, 
    recessive or degree of freedom coding of the genetic covariate while assuming 
    a true dominant, recessive or additive genetic effect. In addition, power and 
    sample size calculations can be performed for gene by environment interactions.  
    These methods are extensions of Gauderman (2002) 
    <doi:10.1093/aje/155.5.478> and Gauderman (2002) <doi:10.1002/sim.973>
    and are described in:

    for Genetic Association Studies in the Presence of Genetic Model Misspecification.
