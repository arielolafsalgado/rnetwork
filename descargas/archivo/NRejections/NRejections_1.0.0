Description: Implements methods in Mathur and VanderWeele (in preparation) to characterize global evidence strength across W correlated ordinary least squares (OLS) hypothesis tests. Specifically, uses resampling to estimate a null interval for the total number of rejections in, for example, 95% of samples generated with no associations (the global null), the excess hits (the difference between the observed number of rejections and the upper limit of the null interval), and a test of the global null based on the number of rejections.
