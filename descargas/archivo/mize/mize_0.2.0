Description: Optimization algorithms implemented in R, including
    conjugate gradient (CG), Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) and the
    limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) methods. Most internal parameters can be set 
    through the call interface. The solvers hold up quite well for 
    higher-dimensional problems.
