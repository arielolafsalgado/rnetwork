Description: Bland-Altman plot and scatter plot with identity line 
             for visualization and point and 
             interval estimates for different metrics related to 
             reproducibility/repeatability/agreement including
             the concordance correlation coefficient, 
             intraclass correlation coefficient,
             within-subject coefficient of variation,
             smallest detectable difference, 
             and mean normalized smallest detectable difference.
