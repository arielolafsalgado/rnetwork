Description: An extensive set of functions to perform Qualitative Comparative Analysis:
             crisp sets ('csQCA'), temporal ('tQCA'), multivalue ('mvQCA')
             and fuzzy sets ('fsQCA'), using a GUI - graphical user interface.
             'QCA' is a methodology that bridges the qualitative and quantitative divide
             in social science research. It uses a Boolean algorithm that results in a
             minimal causal combination which explains a given phenomenon.
