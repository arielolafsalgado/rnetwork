Description: Creates an area-proportional Venn diagram of 2 or 3 circles. 'BioVenn' is the only R package that can automatically generate an accurate area-proportional Venn diagram by having only lists of (biological) identifiers as input. Also offers the option to map Entrez and/or Affymetrix IDs to Ensembl IDs. In SVG mode, text and numbers can be dragged and dropped. Based on the BioVenn web interface available at <https://www.biovenn.nl>. Hulsen et al. (2008) <doi:10.1186/1471-2164-9-488>.
