Description: Maximin-projection learning (MPL, Shi, et al., 2018) is implemented for 
	recommending a meaningful and reliable individualized treatment regime for future 
	groups of patients based on the observed data from different populations with
	heterogeneity in individualized decision making. Q-learning and A-learning are
	implemented for estimating the groupwise contrast function that shares the same
	marginal treatment effects. The packages contains classical Q-learning and A-learning
	algorithms for a single stage study as a byproduct. More functions will be added
	at later versions.
