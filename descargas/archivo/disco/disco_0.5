Description: Concordance and discordance of homologous gene regulation allows comparing
  reaction to stimuli in different organisms, 
  for example human patients and animal models of a disease. The package
  contains functions to calculate discordance and concordance score
  for homologous gene pairs, identify concordantly or
  discordantly regulated transcriptional modules and visualize the results.
  It is intended for analysis of transcriptional data.
