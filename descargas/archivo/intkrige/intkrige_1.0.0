Title: A Numerical Implementation of Interval-Valued Kriging
Description: An interval-valued extension of ordinary and simple kriging.
    Optimization of the function is based on a generalized interval distance.
    This creates a non-differentiable cost function that requires a
    differentiable approximation to the absolute value function. This
    differentiable approximation is optimized using a Newton-Raphson algorithm
    with a penalty function to impose the constraints. Analyses in the package
    are driven by the 'intsp' and 'intgrd' 
    classes, 
    which are interval-valued extensions of
    'SpatialPointsDataFrame' and 'SpatialPixelsDataFrame' respectively. 
    The package includes several wrappers to functions in the 
    'gstat' and 'sp' packages.
