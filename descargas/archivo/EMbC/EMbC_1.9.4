Description: Unsupervised, multivariate, clustering algorithm for meaningful binary clustering and taking into account the uncertainty in the data. A specific constructor for trajectory movement analysis yields behavioural annotation of the tracks based on estimated local measures of velocity and turning angle, eventually with solar position covariate as a daytime indicator.
