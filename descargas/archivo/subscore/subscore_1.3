Description: Functions for computing test subscores using methods applicable to classical test theory (CTT) scores. This package enables two sets of subscoring methods within the framework of CTT: (1) Wainer's augmentation method, and (2) Haberman's three subscoring methods. The package also includes the function to compute Proportional Reduction of Mean Squared Errors (PRMSEs) proposed by Haberman's, which are used to examine whether test subscores are of added value.
