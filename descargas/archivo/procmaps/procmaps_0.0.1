Description: Portable '/proc/self/maps' as a data frame.
    Determine which library or other region is mapped to a specific
    address of a process. --
    R packages can contain native code, compiled to shared libraries at build or
    installation time.
    When loaded, each shared library occupies a portion of the address space of
    the main process.
    When only a machine instruction pointer is available (e.g. from a backtrace
    during error inspection or profiling), the address space map determines
    which library this instruction pointer corresponds to.
