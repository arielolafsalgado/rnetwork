Description: The ACE file format is currently used in genomics
  to store contigs from ABI sequencing machines. 
  To the best of our knowledge, no R function is available to convert 
  this format into the more popular fastq file format. 
  The development was motivated in the context of the analysis of 
  16S metagenomic data by the need to convert the ACE files received
  from a sequencing service for further analysis.
