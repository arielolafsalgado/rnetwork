Description: Calculate regression coefficients and their standard deviations under the Cox proportional hazard model with a large number of covariates. A shrinkage type estimation based on the compound covariate method (Emura, Chen & Chen, 2012 PLoS ONE) and a univariate gene selection method under dependent censoring (Emura & Chen, 2014 Statistical Methods in Medical Research) are implemented. Algorithms for simulating gene expressions in these references are also given.
