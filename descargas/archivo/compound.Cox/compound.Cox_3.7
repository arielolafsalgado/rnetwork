Description: Estimation, gene selection, and survival prediction based on the compound covariate method under the Cox model with high-dimensional gene expressions.
 Available are survival data for non-small-cell lung cancer patients with gene expressions (Chen et al 2007 New Engl J Med) <DOI:10.1056/NEJMoa060096>,
 statistical methods in Emura et al (2012 PLoS ONE) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0047627> and
 Emura & Chen (2016 Stat Methods Med Res) <DOI:10.1177/0962280214533378>. Algorithms for generating correlated gene expressions are also available.
