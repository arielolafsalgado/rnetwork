Title: Weighting for Covariate Balance in Observational Studies
Version: 0.5.1
Author: Noah Greifer [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Noah Greifer <noah.greifer@gmail.com>
Description: Generates weights to form equivalent groups in observational studies by easing and extending the functionality of the R packages 'twang' (Ridgeway et al., 2017) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=twang> for generalized boosted modeling, 'CBPS' (Fong, Ratkovic, & Imai, 2018) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CBPS> for covariate balancing propensity score weighting, 'ebal' (Hainmueller, 2014) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ebal> for entropy balancing, 'optweight' (Greifer, 2018) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=optweight> for optimization-based weights, 'ATE' (Haris & Chan, 2015) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ATE> for empirical balancing calibration weighting, and SuperLearner (Polley, LeDell, Kenney, & van der Laan, 2018) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SuperLearner>. Also allows for assessment of weights and checking of covariate balance by interfacing directly with 'cobalt' (Greifer, 2018) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cobalt>.
