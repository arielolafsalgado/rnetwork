Title: Weighting for Covariate Balance in Observational Studies
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Noah Greifer [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Noah Greifer <noah@unc.edu>
Description: Generates weights to form equivalent groups in observational studies by easing and extending the functionality of the R packages 'twang' (Ridgeway et al., 2017) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=twang> for generalized boosted modeling, 'CBPS' (Fong, Ratkovic, & Imai, 2017) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CBPS> for covariate balancing propensity score weighting, 'ebal' (Hainbueller, 2014) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ebal> for entropy balancing, and 'ATE' (Haris & Chan, 2015) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ATE> for empirical balancing calibration weighting. Also allows for assessment of weights and checking of covariate balance by interfacing directly with 'cobalt' (Greifer, 2017) <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cobalt>.
