Title: Fst-Heterozygosity Smoothed Quantiles
Description: A program to generate smoothed quantiles for the Fst-heterozygosity distribution. Designed for use with large numbers of loci (e.g., genome-wide SNPs). The best case for analyzing the Fst-heterozygosity distribution is when many populations (>10) have been sampled. See Flanagan & Jones (2017) <doi:10.1093/jhered/esx048>.
