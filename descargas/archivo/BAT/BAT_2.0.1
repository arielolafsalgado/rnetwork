Description: Includes algorithms to assess alpha and beta
    diversity in all their dimensions (taxon, phylogenetic and functional
    diversity), whether communities are completely sampled or not. It allows
    performing a number of analyses based on either species identities or
    phylogenetic/functional trees or functional kernel n-dimensional hypervolumes
    depicting species relationships.
