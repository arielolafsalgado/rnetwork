Description: For a multisite replication project, computes metrics and confidence intervals representing: (1) the probability that the original study would observe an estimated effect size as extreme or more extreme than it actually did, if in fact the original study is statistically consistent with the replications; (2) the probability of a true effect of scientifically meaningful size in the same direction as the estimate the original study; and (3) the probability of a true effect of meaningful size in the direction opposite the original study's estimate. Additionally computes older metrics used in replication projects (namely expected agreement in "statistical significance" between an original study and replication studies as well as prediction intervals for the replication estimates). See Mathur and VanderWeele (in preparation) <https://osf.io/apnjk/> for details.
