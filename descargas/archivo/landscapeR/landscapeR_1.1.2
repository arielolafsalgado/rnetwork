Description: Simulates categorical maps on actual geographical realms, starting from either empty landscapes or landscapes provided by the user (e.g. land use maps). Allows to tweak or create landscapes while retaining a high degree of control on its features, without the hassle of specifying each location attribute. In this it differs from other tools which generate null or neutral landscapes in a theoretical space. The basic algorithm currently implemented uses a simple agent style/cellular automata growth model, with no rules (apart from areas of exclusion). Outputs are raster dataset exportable to any common GIS format.
