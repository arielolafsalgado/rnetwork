Description: This package provides a platform where Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) based on copulas can be implemented and studied. It contains complete implementations of various EDAs based on copulas and vines, and it also offers the possibility of implementing new algorithms. EDAs are implemented using S4 classes with generic functions for its main parts: seeding, selection, learning, sampling, replacement, local optimization, termination, and reporting. The package also provides a group of well-known benchmark problems and utility functions to study the behavior of EDAs.
