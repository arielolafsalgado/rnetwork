Description: Fast algorithms for fitting Bayesian variable selection
    models and computing Bayes factors, in which the outcome (or
    response variable) is modeled using a linear regression or a
    logistic regression. The algorithms are based on the variational
    approximations described in "Scalable variational inference for
    Bayesian variable selection in regression, and its accuracy in
    genetic association studies" (P. Carbonetto & M. Stephens, 2012,
    <DOI:10.1214/12-BA703>). This software has been applied to large
    data sets with over a million variables and thousands of samples.
