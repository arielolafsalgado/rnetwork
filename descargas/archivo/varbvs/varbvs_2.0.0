Title: Large-Scale Bayesian Variable Selection Using Variational
        Methods
Author: Peter Carbonetto, Matthew Stephens
Maintainer: Peter Carbonetto <peter.carbonetto@gmail.com>
Description: Fast algorithms for fitting Bayesian variable selection models and computing Bayes factors, in which the outcome (or response variable) is modeled using a linear regression or a logistic regression. The algorithms are based on the variational approximations described in "Scalable variational inference for Bayesian variable selection in regression, and its accuracy in genetic association studies" (P. Carbonetto & M. Stephens, 2012, <DOI:10.1214/12-BA703>). This software has been applied to large data sets with over a million variables and thousands of samples.
