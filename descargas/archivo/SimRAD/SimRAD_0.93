Description: This package provides a number of functions to simulate restriction enzyme digestion, library construction and fragments size selection to predict the number of loci expected from most of the Restriction site Associated DNA (RAD) and Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) approaches. SimRAD aims is to provide an estimation of the number of loci expected from a particular genome depending on the protocol type and parameters allowing to assess feasibility, multiplexing capacity and the amount of sequencing required.
