Title: Sensitivity Analysis for Publication Bias in Meta-Analyses
Version: 2.1.0
Author: Maya B. Mathur, Tyler J. VanderWeele
Maintainer: Maya B. Mathur <mmathur@stanford.edu>
Description: Performs sensitivity analysis for publication bias in meta-analyses (per Mathur & VanderWeele, 2020 [<https://osf.io/s9dp6>]).
    These analyses enable statements such as: "For publication bias to shift the observed point estimate to the null,
    'significant' results would need to be at least 30-fold more likely to be published than negative or 'nonsignificant'
    results." Comparable statements can be made regarding shifting to a chosen non-null value or shifting the confidence
    interval. Provides a worst-case meta-analytic point estimate under maximal publication bias obtained simply by conducting
    a standard meta-analysis of only the negative and "nonsignificant" studies.
