Title: Software Option Settings Manager for R
Version: 0.2.2
Date: 2015-06-01
Author: Mark van der Loo
Maintainer: Mark van der Loo <mark.vanderloo@gmail.com>
Description: Provides option settings management that goes
    beyond R's default 'options' function. With this package, users can define
    their own option settings manager holding option names and default values.
    Settings can then be retrieved, altered and reset to defaults with ease.
    For R programmers and package developers it offers cloning and merging
    functionality which allows for conveniently defining global and local
    options, possibly in a multilevel options hierarchy. See the package
    vignette for some examples concerning functions, S4 classes, and reference
    classes. There are convenience functions to reset par() and options() to
    their 'factory defaults'.
