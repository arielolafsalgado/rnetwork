Description: One of the remaining pain points in making beautiful maps via 
    packages like 'rayshader' is both obtaining and processing spatial data
    to build from. 'spacey' aims to make it easier to obtain and use this data
    for locations within the United States, providing utilities to download 
    'USGS' and 'ESRI' geospatial data and quickly turn it into maps.
