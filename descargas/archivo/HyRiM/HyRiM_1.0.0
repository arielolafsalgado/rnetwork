Description: Construction and analysis of multivalued zero-sum matrix games over the abstract space of probability distributions, which describe the losses in each scenario of defense vs. attack action. The distributions can be compiled directly from expert opinions or other empirical data (insofar available). The package implements the methods put forth in the EU project HyRiM (Hybrid Risk Management for Utility Networks), FP7 EU Project Number 608090.
