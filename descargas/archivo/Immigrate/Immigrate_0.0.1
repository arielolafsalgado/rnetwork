Package: Immigrate
Title: Iterative Max-Min Entropy Margin-Maximization with Interaction
        Terms for Feature Selection
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Ruzhang Zhao, Pengyu Hong, Jun S. Liu
Description: Based on large margin principle, this package performs feature selection methods: "IM4E"(Iterative Margin-Maximization under Max-Min Entropy Algorithm); "imIM4E"(imbalance Iterative Margin-Maximization under Max-Min Entropy Algorithm); "Immigrate"(Iterative Max-Min Entropy Margin-Maximization with Interaction Terms Algorithm); "Simba"(Iterative Search Margin Based Algorithm); "LFE"(Local Feature Extraction Algorithm). This package also performs prediction for the above feature selection methods.
