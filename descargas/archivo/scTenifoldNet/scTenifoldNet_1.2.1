Description: A workflow based on machine learning methods to construct and compare single-cell gene regulatory networks (scGRN) using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data collected from different conditions. Uses principal component regression, tensor decomposition, and manifold alignment, to accurately identify even subtly shifted gene expression programs.
