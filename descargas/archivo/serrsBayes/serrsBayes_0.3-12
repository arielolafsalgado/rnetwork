Description: Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms for fitting a generalised additive
    mixed model (GAMM) to surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy (SERRS),
    using the method of Moores et al. (2016) <arXiv:1604.07299>. Multivariate
    observations of SERRS are highly collinear and lend themselves to a reduced-rank
    representation. The GAMM separates the SERRS signal into three components: a
    sequence of Lorentzian, Gaussian, or pseudo-Voigt peaks; a smoothly-varying baseline;
    and additive white noise. The parameters of each component of the model are estimated
    iteratively using SMC. The posterior distributions of the parameters given the observed
    spectra are represented as a population of weighted particles.
