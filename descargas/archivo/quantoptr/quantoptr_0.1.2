Description: Estimation methods for optimal treatment regimes under three different criteria, namely marginal quantile, marginal mean, and mean absolute difference. For the first two criteria, both one-stage and two-stage estimation method are implemented. A doubly robust estimator for estimating the quantile-optimal treatment regime is also included.
