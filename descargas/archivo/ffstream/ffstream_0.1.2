Title: Forgetting Factor Methods for Change Detection in Streaming Data
Version: 0.1.2
Author: Dean Bodenham
Maintainer: Dean Bodenham <deanbodenhambsse@gmail.com>
Description: An implementation of the adaptive forgetting factor scheme described in Bodenham and Adams (2016) <doi:10.1007/s11222-016-9684-8> which adaptively estimates the mean and variance of a stream in order to detect multiple changepoints in streaming data. The implementation is in C++ and uses Rcpp. Additionally, implementations of the fixed forgetting factor scheme from the same paper, as well as the classic CUSUM and EWMA methods, are included.
