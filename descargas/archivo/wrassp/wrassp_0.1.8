Description: A wrapper around Michel Scheffers's 'libassp' (<http://libassp.sourceforge.net/>). 
    The 'libassp' (Advanced Speech Signal Processor) library aims at providing
    functionality for handling speech signal files in most common audio formats
    and for performing analyses common in phonetic science/speech science. This
    includes the calculation of formants, fundamental frequency, root mean
    square, auto correlation, a variety of spectral analyses, zero crossing
    rate, filtering etc. This wrapper provides R with a large subset of
    'libassp's signal processing functions and provides them to the user in a
    (hopefully) user-friendly manner.
