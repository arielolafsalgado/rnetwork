Description: Package provides pipe-style interface for 'data.table'. It preserves all
    'data.table' features without significant impact on performance. 'let'
    and 'take' functions are simplified interfaces for most common data manipulation
    tasks. For example, you can write 'mtcars %>% take(mean(mpg), by = am)' for 
    aggregation or 'mtcars %>% let(hp_wt = hp/wt, hp_wt_mpg = hp_wt/mpg)' for modification.
    Use 'take_if/let_if' for conditional aggregation/modification. 'query_if' function
    translates its arguments one-to-one to '[.data.table' method. Additionally there are
    some conveniences such as automatic 'data.frame' conversion to 'data.table'.
