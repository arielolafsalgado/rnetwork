Title: Implementation of Parametric Formulas for Soil Water Retention
        or Conductivity Curve
Type: Package
Author: Emanuele Cordano, Daniele Andreis, Fabio Zottele
Description: It is a set of R implementations of parametric formulas of soil water
    retention or conductivity curve. At the moment, only Van Genuchten (for
    soil water retention curve) and Mualem (for hydraulic conductivity) were
    implemented. See reference
    \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_retention_curve}.
