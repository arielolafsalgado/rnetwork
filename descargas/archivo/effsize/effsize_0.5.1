Author: Marco Torchiano
Maintainer: Marco Torchiano <marco.torchiano@polito.it>
Description: This package contains the functions to compute the standardized 
  effect sizes for experiments (Cohen d, Hedges g, Cliff delta, Vargha and Delaney A). 
  The computation algorithms have been optimized to allow efficient computation even 
  with very large data sets.
