Title: Integrated Tool for Hairping Extraction of RNA Sequences
Version: 1.0
Author: Cristian Yones
Maintainer: Cristian Yones <cyones@sinc.unl.edu.ar>
Description: Simple and integrated tool that automatically extracts and folds all hairpin sequences from raw genome-wide data. It predicts the secondary structure of several overlapped segments, with longer length than the mean length of sequences of interest for the species under processing, ensuring that no one is lost nor inappropriately cut.
