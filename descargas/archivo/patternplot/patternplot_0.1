Description: Creates aesthetically pleasing and informative pie charts. 
             It can plot pie charts either in black and white or in colors, 
             with or without filled patterns. On the one hand, black and white pie charts filled 
			 with patterns are useful for publications, especially when an increasing 
			 number of journals only accept black and white figures or charge a 
			 significant amount for a color figure. On the other hand, colorful pie
			 charts with or without patterns are useful for print design, online publishing,
			 or poster and 'PowerPoint' presentations. 'patternplot' allows the flexibility of a
			 variety of combinations of patterns and colors to choose from. It also has the
			 ability to fill in the slices with any external images in 'png' and 'jpeg' formats.
			 In summary, 'patternplot' allows the users to be as creative as they can while
			 creating pie charts!
