Title: Landscape Utility Toolbox
Version: 0.3.0
Description: Provides utility functions to complete tasks involved in most
    landscape analysis. It includes functions to coerce raster data to the
    common tibble format and vice versa, it helps with flexible reclassification
    tasks of raster data and it provides a function to merge multiple raster.
    Furthermore, 'landscapetools' helps landscape scientists to visualize their
    data by providing optional themes and utility functions to plot single
    landscapes, rasterstacks, -bricks and lists of raster.
