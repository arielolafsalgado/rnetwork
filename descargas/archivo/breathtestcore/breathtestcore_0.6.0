Description: Reads several formats of 13C data (IRIS/Wagner,
    BreathID) and CSV.  Creates artificial sample data for testing.  Fits
    Maes/Ghoos, Bluck-Coward self-correcting formula using 'nls', 'nlme'.
    Methods to fit breath test curves with Bayesian Stan methods are
    refactored to package 'breathteststan'. For a Shiny GUI, see package
    'dmenne/breathtestshiny' on github.
