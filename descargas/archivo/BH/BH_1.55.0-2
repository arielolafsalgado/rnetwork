Description: Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source 
 libraries.  A large part of Boost is provided as C++ template code
 which is resolved entirely at compile-time without linking.  This 
 package aims to provide the most useful subset of Boost libraries 
 for template use among CRAN package. By placing these libraries in 
 this package, we offer a more efficient distribution system for CRAN 
 as replication of this code in the sources of other packages is 
 avoided.
