Description: 
    Easy visualization, wrangling, and feature engineering of time series data for 
    forecasting and machine learning prediction. 
    Methods discussed herein are commonplace in machine learning, and have been cited 
    in various literature. Refer to "Calendar Effects" in papers such as
