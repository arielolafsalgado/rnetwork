Description: list is a publicly available R package that allows
        researchers to conduct multivariate statistical analyses of
        survey data with list experiments. In addition, the package
        implements the statistical test that is designed to detect
        certain failures of list experiments. This survey methodology
        is also known as the item count technique or the unmatched
        count technique and is an alternative to the commonly used
        randomized response method. The package implements the methods
        developed by Imai (2011), Blair and Imai (2012), Blair,
        Imai, and Lyall (2013), and Imai, Park, and Greene (2014). 
	This includes a Bayesian MCMC implementation of regression 
	for the standard and multiple sensitive item list experiment 
	designs and a random effects setup, a Bayesian MCMC hierarchical 
	regression model with up to three hierarchical groups, the 
	combined list experiment and endorsement experiment regression 
	model, and a joint model of the list experiment that enables
	the analysis of the list experiment as a predictor in 
	outcome regression models.
