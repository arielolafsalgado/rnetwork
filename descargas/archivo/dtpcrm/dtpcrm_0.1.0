Description: Provides the dose transition pathways (DTP) to project in advance
    the doses recommended by a model-based design for subsequent patients (stay,
    escalate, deescalate or stop early) using all the accumulated toxicity
    information; See Yap et al (2017) <doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-17-0582>. DTP
    can be used as a design and an operational tool and can be displayed as a
    table or flow diagram. The 'dtpcrm' package also provides the modified
    continual reassessment method (CRM) and time-to-event CRM (TITE-CRM) with
    added practical considerations to allow stopping early when there is
    sufficient evidence that the lowest dose is too toxic and/or there is a
    sufficient number of patients dosed at the maximum tolerated dose.
