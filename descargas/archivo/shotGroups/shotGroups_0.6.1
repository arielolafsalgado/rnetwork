Description: Analyzes shooting data with respect to group shape,
        precision, and accuracy. This includes graphical methods,
        descriptive statistics, and inference tests using standard,
        but also non-parametric and robust statistical methods.
        Implements distributions for radial error in bivariate normal
        variables. Works with files exported by OnTarget PC/TDS or
        Taran, as well as with custom data files in text format.
