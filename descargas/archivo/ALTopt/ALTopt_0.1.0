Description: This package creates the optimal (D, U and I) designs for
    the accelerated life testing with right censoring or interval censoring.
    It uses generalized linear model (GLM) approach to derive the asymptotic
    variance-covariance matrix of regression coefficients. The failure time
    distribution is assumed to follow Weibull distribution with a known shape
    parameter and log-linear link functions are used to model the relationship
    between failure time parameters and stress variables. Any number of stress
    factors can be used but no more than 3 are recommended due to the
    computational time. ALTopt package also provides several plotting functions
    including contour plot, Fraction of Use Space (FUS) plot and Variance
    Dispersion graphs of Use Space (VDUS) plot.
