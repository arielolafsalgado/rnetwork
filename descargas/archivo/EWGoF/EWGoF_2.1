Description: An implementation of a large number of the goodness-of-fit tests for the exponential and Weibull distributions classified into families: the tests based on the empirical distribution function, the tests based on the probability plot, the tests based on the normalized spacings, the tests based on the Laplace transform and the likelihood-based tests.
