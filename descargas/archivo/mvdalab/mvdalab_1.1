Description: An open-source project implementation of latent variable methods and multivariate modeling tools. The focus is on exploratory analyses using dimensionality reduction methods including low dimensional embedding, classical multivariate statistical tools , and tools for enhanced interpretation of machine learning methods (i.e. intelligible models to provide important information for end-users).   Target domains include extension to dedicated applications e.g. for manufacturing process modeling, spectroscopic analyses, and data mining.
