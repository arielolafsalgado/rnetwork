Description: The methods implemented here were based in the protocol proposed by Merchuk et al. (1998) and Murugesan & Perumalsamy (2005) to analyse Aqueous Two-Phases Systems. Each function brings in its description the reference for the original article which described it. These methods defines nonlinear equations that can be used to fit experimental data through regression methods and also allow us calculate other important system parameters (such as its critical composition, equivolume concentration and phase's composition). The package will include (every other update) new functions in order to comprise useful functions in liquid-liquid analysis.
