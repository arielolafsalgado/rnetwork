Description: Fast generic solver for sparse group lasso optimization
    problems. The loss (objective) function must be defined in a C++ module.
    The optimization problem is solved using a coordinate gradient
    descent algorithm. The algorithm is applicable to a broad class of convex
    loss functions. Convergence of the algorithm is established (see reference).    Use of parallel computing for cross validation and subsampling is supported through
    the 'foreach' and 'doParallel' packages. Development version is on github, please report package issues on github. Development version is on github, please report package issues on github.
