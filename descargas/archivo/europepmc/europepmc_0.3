Description: An R Client for the Europe PubMed Central RESTful Web Service
    (see <https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebService> for more information). It
    gives access to both metadata on life science literature and open access
    full texts. Europe PMC indexes all PubMed content and other literature
    sources including Agricola, a bibliographic database of citations to the
    agricultural literature, or Biological Patents. In addition to bibliographic
    metadata, the client allows users to fetch citations and reference lists.
    Links between life-science literature and other EBI databases, including
    ENA, PDB or ChEMBL are also accessible. No registration or API key is
    required. See the vignettes for usage examples.
