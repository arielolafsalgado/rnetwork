Description: An R Client for the Europe PubMed Central RESTful Web Service. It
    gives access to both metadata on life science literature and open access
    full texts. Europe PMC indexes all PubMed content and other literature
    sources including Agricola, a bibliographic database of citations to the
    agricultural literature, or Biological Patents. In addition to bibliographic
    metadata, the client allows users to fetch citations and reference lists.
    Links between life-science literature and other EBI databases, including
    ENA, PDB or ChEMBL are also accessible. No registration or API key is
    required. See the vignettes for usage examples.
