Description: Tool to automatically fetch, transform and arrange subsets of multidimensional data sets (collections of files) stored in local and/or remote file systems or servers, using multicore capabilities where possible. The tool provides an interface to perceive a collection of data sets as a single large multidimensional data array, and enables the user to request for automatic retrieval, processing and arrangement of subsets of the large array. Wrapper functions to add support for custom file formats can be plugged in/out, making the tool suitable for any research field where large multidimensional data sets are involved.
