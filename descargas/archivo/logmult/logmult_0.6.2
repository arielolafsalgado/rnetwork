Description: Functions to fit log-multiplicative models using gnm, with
  support for convenient printing, plots, and jackknife/bootstrap
  standard errors. For complex survey data, models can be fitted from
  design objects from the 'survey' package. Currently supported models
  include UNIDIFF (Erikson & Goldthorpe), a.k.a. log-multiplicative
  layer effect model (Xie), and several association models: Goodman's
  row-column association models of the RC(M) and RC(M)-L families
  with one or several dimensions; two skew-symmetric association
  models proposed by Yamaguchi and by van der Heijden & Mooijaart.
