Description: Carries out model-based clustering, classification and discriminant analysis using five different models. The models are all based on the  generalized hyperbolic distribution. The first model 'MGHD' (Browne and McNicholas (2015)<doi:10.1002/cjs.11246>) is the classical mixture of generalized hyperbolic distributions. The 'MGHFA' (Tortora et al. (2016)<doi:10.1007/s11634-015-0204-z>) is the mixture of generalized hyperbolic factor analyzers for high dimensional data sets. The 'MSGHD'(Tortora et al. (2016)<arXiv:1403.2332v7>), mixture of  multiple scaled generalized hyperbolic distributions. The 'cMSGHD' (Tortora et al. (2016)<arXiv:1403.2332v7>) is a 'MSGHD' with convex contour plots. The 'MCGHD' (Tortora et al. (2016)<arXiv:1403.2332v7>), mixture of  coalesced generalized hyperbolic distributions is a new more flexible model.
