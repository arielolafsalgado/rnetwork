Description: Carries out model-based clustering using three different models. The models are all based on the  generalized hyperbolic distribution.The first model MGHD is the classical mixture of generalized hyperbolic distributions. The MGHFA is the mixture of generalized hyperbolic factor analyzers for high dimensional data sets. The MCGHD, mixture of  coalesced generalized hyperbolic distributions is a new more flexible model.
