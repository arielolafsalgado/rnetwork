Description: Provides users the necessary utility functions to generate permutation-based QQ plots and also estimate inflation factor based on the empirical NULL distribution. While it has general utility, it is particularly helpful when the skewness of the Fisher's Exact test in sparse data situations with imbalanced case-control sample sizes renders the reliance on the uniform chi-square expected distribution inappropriate.
