Description: This is an implementation of constrained dual scaling for detecting response 
    styles in categorical data, including utility functions. The procedure involves adding 
    additional columns to the data matrix representing the boundaries between the rating categories.
    The resulting matrix is then doubled and analyzed by dual scaling. One-dimensional solutions are
    sought which provide optimal scores for the rating categories. These optimal scores are 
    constrained to follow monotone quadratic splines. Clusters are introduced within which the 
    response styles can vary. The type of response style present in a cluster can be diagnosed 
    from the optimal scores for said cluster, and this can be used to construct an
    imputed version of the data set which adjusts for response styles.
