Author: Javier López-de-Lacalle <javlacalle@yahoo.es>

Depends: R (>= 3.0.0), stats

Description: Seasonal unit roots and seasonal stability tests.
    P-values based on response surface regressions are available for both tests.
    P-values based on bootstrap are available for seasonal unit root tests.
    A parallel implementation of the bootstrap method requires a CUDA capable GPU 
    with compute capability >= 3.0, otherwise a debugging version fully coded in R is used.
