Title: Feature-Based Landscape Analysis of Continuous and Constraint
        Optimization Problems
Description: Contains tools and features, which can be used for an exploratory
    landscape analysis of continuous optimization problems. Those are able to
    quantify rather complex properties, such as the global structure,
    separability, etc., of continuous optimization problems.
