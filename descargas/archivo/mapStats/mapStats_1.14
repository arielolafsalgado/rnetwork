Description: mapStats will calculate statistics (mean, total, and
        quantiles) for survey variables, by geography level
        (e.g. state, county), and an optional class variable (such as
        year, if the multiple years are included).  The statistics for
        each variable are then plotted on a shapefile with color
        codes.  Statistics may be calculated either weighted or
        unweighted.
