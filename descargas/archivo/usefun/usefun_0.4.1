Description: A set of general functions that I have used in various 
  projects and in other R packages. They support some miscellaneous operations 
  on data frames, matrices and vectors: adding a row on a ternary (3-value)
  data.frame based on positive and negative vector-indicators, rearranging a 
  list of data.frames by rownames, pruning rows or columns of a data.frame 
  that contain only one specific value given by the user, checking for matrix equality,
  pruning and reordering a vector according to the common elements between its 
  names and elements of another given vector, finding the non-common elements 
  between two vectors (outer-section), 
  normalization of a vector, matrix or data.frame's numeric values in a specified range, 
  pretty printing of vector names and values in an R notebook (common names and 
  values between two vectors also supported), retrieving the parent directory of 
  any string path, checking whether a numeric value is inside a given interval, 
  trim the decimal points of a given numeric value, quick saving of data to a file, 
  making a multiple densities plot and a color bar plot and executing a plot 
  string expression while generating the result to the specified file format.
