Title: Significance Bars for 'ggplot2'
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: person("Constantin", "Ahlmann-Eltze", email = "artjom31415@googlemail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Enrich your ggplots with group-wise comparisons.
  This package provides an easy way to indicate if two groups are significantly different.
  Commonly this is shown by a bar on top connecting the groups of interest which itself is annotated with the level of significance (NS, *, **, ***).
  The package provides a single layer (geom_signif()) that takes the groups for comparison and the test (t.test(), wilcox.text() etc.) as arguments and adds the annotation
  to the plot.
