Title: Graph Theory Analysis of Brain MRI Data
Author: Christopher G. Watson <cgwatson@bu.edu>
Maintainer: Christopher G. Watson <cgwatson@bu.edu>
Description: A set of tools for performing graph theory analysis of brain MRI
    data. It works with data from a Freesurfer analysis (cortical thickness,
    volumes, local gyrification index, surface area), diffusion tensor
    tractography data (e.g., from FSL) and resting-state fMRI data (e.g., from
    DPABI). It contains a graphical user interface for graph visualization and
    data exploration, along with several functions for generating useful
    figures.
