Description: Computes (constructs, plots and evaluates) constrained cubic Hermite splines, which can be used to construct monotonic splines. Computes their first derivatives, indefinite integrals and smooth approximations of their first, second and higher derivatives. Also, computes their roots, including their argmins, argmaxs and inflection points.
