Description: This package implements the "shrinkage t" statistic 
   introduced in Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer (2007) and a shrinkage estimate
   of the "correlation-adjusted t-score" (cat score) described in
   Zuber and Strimmer (2009).  It also offers a convenient interface 
   to a number of other regularized t-statistics commonly 
   employed in high-dimensional case-control studies.
