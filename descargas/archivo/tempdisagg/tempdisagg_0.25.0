Description: Temporal disaggregation methods are used to disaggregate and
    interpolate a low frequency time series to a higher frequency series, where
    either the sum, the average, the first or the last value of the resulting
    high frequency series is consistent with the low frequency series. Temporal
    disaggregation can be performed with or without one or more high frequency
    indicator series. Contains the methods of Chow-Lin, Santos-Silva-Cardoso, 
    Fernandez, Litterman, Denton and Denton-Cholette.
