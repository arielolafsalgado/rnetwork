Description: This package provides functions to compute Marcus, Marcus-Levich-Jortner or Landau-Zener charge transfer rates. These rates can then be used to perform kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to estimate charge carrier mobilities in molecular materials. The preparation of this package was supported by the the Fondazione Cariplo (PLENOS project, ref. 2011-0349).
