Description: A toolkit with infrastructure for representing, summarizing, and
  visualizing tree-structured regression and classification models. This
  unified infrastructure can be used for reading/coercing tree models from
  different sources (rpart, RWeka, PMML) yielding objects that share
  functionality for print/plot/predict methods. Furthermore, new and improved
  reimplementations of conditional inference trees (ctree) and model-based
  recursive partitioning (mob) from the party package are provided based
  on the new infrastructure.
