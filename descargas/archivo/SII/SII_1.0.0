Description: This package calculates ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech
        Intelligibility Index (SII), a standard method for computing
        the intelligibility of speech from acoustical measurements of
        speech, noise, and hearing thresholds. This package includes
        data frames corresponding to Tables 1 - 4 in the ANSI standard
        as well as a function utilizing these tables and user-provided
        hearing threshold and noise level measurements to compute the
        SII score.  The methods implemented here extend the standard
        computations to allow calculation of SII when the measured
        frequencies do not match those required by the standard by
        applying interpolation to obtain values for the required
        frequencies -- Development of this package was funded by the
        Center for Bioscience Education and Technology (CBET) of the
        Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).
