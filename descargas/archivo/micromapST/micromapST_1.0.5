Description: This package provides the user with the ability to quickly create Linked 
     Micromap plots of the 50 U.S. states and District of Columbia (51 areas).
     Linked Micromap plots are visualizations of geo-referenced data that link statistical
     graphics to an organized series of small maps. 
     The Help description contains examples of how to use the micromapST function.
     This package contains the US and State boundary files and U. S. FIPS code to State conversion tables 
     used by the micromapST function and several data sets used in the micromapST examples.
