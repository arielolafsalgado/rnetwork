Description: Support vector machines (SVMs) and related kernel-based learning
    algorithms are a well-known class of machine learning algorithms, for
    non-parametric classification and regression.
    liquidSVM is an implementation of SVMs whose key features are:
    fully integrated hyper-parameter selection,
    extreme speed on both small and large data sets,
    full flexibility for experts, and
    inclusion of a variety of different learning scenarios:
    multi-class classification, ROC, and Neyman-Pearson learning, and
    least-squares, quantile, and expectile regression.
