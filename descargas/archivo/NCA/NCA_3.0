Description: Performs a Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA). (Dul, J. 2016. Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA). ''Logic and Methodology of 'Necessary but not Sufficient' causality." Organizational Research Methods 19(1), 10-52,
  <http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1094428115584005>).
  NCA identifies necessary (but not sufficient) conditions in datasets, where x causes (e.g. precedes) y. Instead of drawing a regression line ''through the middle of the data'' in an xy-plot, NCA draws the ceiling line. The ceiling line y = f(x) separates the area with observations from the area without observations.
  (Nearly) all observations are below the ceiling line: y <= f(x). The empty zone is in the upper left hand corner of the xy-plot (with the convention that the x-axis is ''horizontal'' and the y-axis is ''vertical'' and that values increase ''upwards'' and ''to the right''). The ceiling line is a (piecewise) linear non-decreasing line: a linear step function or a straight line. It indicates which level of x (e.g. an effort or input) is necessary but not sufficient for a (desired) level of y (e.g. good performance or output).
