Description: In the situation when multiple alternative treatments or
    interventions available, different population groups may respond differently
    to different treatments. This package implements a method that discovers
    the population subgroups in which a certain treatment has a better effect
    than the other alternative treatments. This is done by first estimating the
    treatment effect for a given treatment and its uncertainty by computing random
    forests, and the resulting model is summarized by a decision tree in which the
    probabilities that the given treatment is best for a given subgroup is shown in
    the corresponding terminal node of the tree.
