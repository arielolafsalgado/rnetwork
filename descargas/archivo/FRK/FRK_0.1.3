Description: Fixed Rank Kriging is a tool for spatial/spatio-temporal modelling
    and prediction with large datasets. The approach, discussed in Cressie and
    Johannesson (2008) <DOI:10.1111/j.1467-9868.2007.00633.x>, decomposes the field, 
    and hence the covariance function, using a fixed set of n basis functions, 
    where n is typically much smaller than the number of data points (or polygons) m. 
    The method naturally allows for non-stationary, anisotropic covariance functions 
    and the use of observations with varying support (with known error variance). The 
    projected field is a key building block of the Spatial Random Effects (SRE) model, 
    on which this package is based. The package FRK provides helper functions to model, 
    fit, and predict using an SRE with relative ease.
