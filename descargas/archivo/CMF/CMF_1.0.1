Description: Collective matrix factorization (CMF) finds joint low-rank
	representations for a collection of matrices with shared row or column
	entities. This code learns variational Bayesian approximation for CMF,
	supporting multiple likelihood potentials and missing data, while
	identifying both factors shared by multiple matrices and factors private
	for each matrix.
