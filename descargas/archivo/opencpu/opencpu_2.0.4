Description: A system for embedded scientific computing and reproducible research with R.
    The OpenCPU server exposes a simple but powerful HTTP api for RPC and data interchange
    with R. This provides a reliable and scalable foundation for statistical services or 
    building R web applications. The OpenCPU server runs either as a single-user development
    server within the interactive R session, or as a multi-user Linux stack based on Apache2. 
    The entire system is fully open source and permissively licensed. The OpenCPU website
    has detailed documentation and example apps.
