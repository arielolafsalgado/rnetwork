Description: It implements many univariate and multivariate permutation (and rotation) tests. Allowed tests: the t one and two samples, ANOVA, linear models, Chi Squared test, rank tests (i.e. Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis), Sign test and McNemar. Test on Linear Models are performed also in presence of covariates (i.e. nuisance parameters). The permutation and the rotation methods to get the null distribution of the test statistics are available. It also implements methods for multiplicity control such as Westfall-Young minP procedure and Closed Testing (Marcus, 1976) and k-FWER. Moreover, it allows to test for fixed effects in mixed effects models.
