Description: SigTree takes a phylogenetic tree (of class phylo) and a data frame (or matrix) of corresponding tip labels and p-values and determines the significance of the branches (families of p-values) and plots the tree with colored branches (corresponding to families) according to their levels of significance.  Also produces a CSV file with the p-values of all of the branches as well as which tips belong to which branches.  Finally, it exports a file that can be opened in FigTree that produces a colored plot (colored branches according to their significance of corresponding groups of p-values) with p-value annotations.
