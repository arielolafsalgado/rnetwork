Version: 1.0.0
Author: Adrian (Abbas) Salavaty

Description: Contains functions for reconstruction of networks from
    adjacency matrices and data frames, analysis of the topology of the network 
    and calculation of centrality measures, and identification of the most
    influential nodes. Also, some functions have been provided for the assessment 
    of dependence and correlation of two network centrality measures as well as 
    the conditional probability of deviation from their corresponding means in opposite direction.
