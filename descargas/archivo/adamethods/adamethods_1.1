Title: Archetypoid Algorithms and Anomaly Detection
Version: 1.1
Date: 2018-11-26
Author: Guillermo Vinue, Irene Epifanio
Maintainer: Guillermo Vinue <Guillermo.Vinue@uv.es>
Description: Collection of several algorithms to obtain archetypoids with small and large databases and with both classical 
	multivariate data and functional data (univariate and multivariate). Some of these algorithms also allow to detect 
	anomalies (outliers).
