Description: Symbolic calculation and evaluation of the Jack polynomials, zonal polynomials, and Schur polynomials. Mainly based on Demmel & Koev's paper (2006) <doi:10.1090/S0025-5718-05-01780-1>. Zonal polynomials and Schur polynomials are particular cases of Jack polynomials. Zonal polynomials appear in random matrix theory. Schur polynomials appear in the field of combinatorics.
