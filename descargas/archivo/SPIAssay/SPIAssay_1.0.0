Description: The SNP Panel Identification Assay (SPIA) is a package
        that enables an accurate determination of cell line identity
        from the genotype of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
        The SPIA test allows to discern when two cell lines are close
        enough to be called similar and when they are not.
